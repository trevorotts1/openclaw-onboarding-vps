# QC Checklist: KIE.ai Setup

## 1. Purpose
Enables the agent to use KIE.ai as the unified API for image, video, and audio generation, with Nano Banana Pro as the default image model.

## 2. Installation Checks
- [ ] Skill folder exists and contains `SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `CORE_UPDATES.md`, the full reference `.md`, and the `.skill` package.
- [ ] The secrets file exists at the documented workspace path and contains a non-placeholder `KIE_API_KEY`.
- [ ] If a master reference copy was required by TYP, the KIE full reference is stored in the master files folder and core files only contain lean pointers.
- [ ] Any optional webhook/HMAC information is stored outside public docs.
- [ ] No executable helper script is required in the skill folder; curl is required for the verification tests.

## 3. Dependency Checks
- [ ] TYP and BYUP are installed first.
- [ ] A KIE.ai account exists and has credits loaded.
- [ ] curl is available for the credit and task tests.
- [ ] The installer understands that all KIE tasks are asynchronous and must be polled or handled via callback.

## 4. Key Detection
- [ ] Search all standard secret locations in order: `/data/openclaw/workspace/secrets/.env`, `/data/.openclaw/openclaw.json` `env.vars`, `/data/.openclaw/.env`, `/data/.openclaw/openclaw.json` `env.vars`, `/data/.openclaw/.env`, live environment, and `~/.env`.
- [ ] Primary variable is `KIE_API_KEY`; if a mirrored config value exists under `env.vars`, it should match the secrets file.
- [ ] If webhook support is used, also detect and document any saved webhook HMAC key without exposing the value.
- [ ] QC fails if the agent reports the key missing without checking all locations first.

## 5. Functional Checks
- [ ] Mask-print the first 10 characters of `KIE_API_KEY` to confirm the environment loads correctly.
- [ ] Call the credit endpoint and confirm a successful balance response.
- [ ] Create a test image task with model `nano-banana-pro` using the documented `createTask` endpoint and capture the returned task ID.
- [ ] Poll the documented status endpoint and confirm the task transitions through a valid async state and eventually returns result data or a valid in-progress state.
- [ ] Ask the agent what a 401, 402, and 429 mean. Expected: bad/missing key, insufficient credits, and rate limit respectively.

## 6. QC Score
- Score this skill from **0 to 10** after running the checks above.
- Suggested rubric:
  - **10/10**: All installation, dependency, key-detection, and functional checks pass with no ambiguity.
  - **8-9/10**: Core behavior works, but one or two non-critical items need cleanup or documentation fixes.
  - **6-7/10**: Basic install exists, but the skill is missing a meaningful validation, dependency, or behavior requirement.
  - **0-5/10**: Missing prerequisite pieces, broken verification path, wrong secrets handling, or failed functional tests.
- Record final result here:
  - **QC Score:** ____ / 10
  - **Status:** Pass / Needs Fix / Blocked
  - **Notes:** ____________________________________________

## 7. QC Loop Rule
- Run at most **5 total QC/fix rounds** for this skill.
- After each failed round:
  1. Record exactly which checklist items failed.
  2. Apply the smallest targeted fix.
  3. Re-run only the failed checks plus any directly affected dependencies.
- If the skill still fails after the **5th round**, stop and escalate instead of continuing to loop.
