  MANDATORY TYP CHECK - READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
  DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS CHECK IS COMPLETE.
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP 1: CHECK IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE TEACH YOURSELF PROTOCOL (TYP)

Before you read, learn, or execute ANY instruction in this document, you must
verify that you have already been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP).

HOW TO CHECK:
- Look in your AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or MEMORY.md for any mention of:
  "Teach Yourself Protocol" or "TYP"
- Look in your session context for prior TYP training
- Look for a tab called "Teach Yourself Protocol" in this same document

IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
Proceed to the instructions below. Follow the TYP file storage structure.

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further. Do not attempt to learn or execute
anything in this document. Tell the user exactly this:

  "I have not been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol yet. I cannot safely
   learn or execute these instructions until I have been taught TYP first.
   Please share the Teach Yourself Protocol tab with me before we proceed.
   Without TYP, I will bloat your core .md files and waste your tokens."

DO NOT PROCEED PAST THIS POINT WITHOUT TYP CONFIRMED.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  TYP FILE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS (only read this if TYP confirmed)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHEN LEARNING THIS DOCUMENT, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:

1. SAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION TO MASTER FILES FOLDER
   Find the OpenClaw master files folder in ~/Downloads/. It may be named:
   - OpenClaw Master Files
   - OpenClaw Master Documents
   - OpenClaw Documents
   - openclaw-master-files
   - openclaw master files
   - OpenClaw Files
   - openclaw-documents
   - Any variation of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents"
   Search case-insensitively. One word or two words. Plural or singular.
   If no folder is found, create: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/

   Save this full document content as a .md file in that folder.
   Example: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/kie-ai-reference.md

2. DO NOT DUMP FULL CONTENT INTO CORE .MD FILES
   AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md must stay lean.
   Only add a brief summary and a file path reference to where the full
   documentation lives. Never paste thousands of lines into core files.

3. USE THE LABELED SECTIONS BELOW TO KNOW WHAT GOES WHERE
   Look for sections marked:
   [ADD TO AGENTS.md]
   [ADD TO TOOLS.md]
   [ADD TO MEMORY.md]
   Only add what is labeled. Nothing else goes into core files.

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY BEFORE YOU START
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

These rules apply every single time you execute instructions from this document.
No exceptions. No shortcuts. No improvising.

RULE 1: READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Read this entire document from top to bottom before executing a single step.
Do not start executing while still reading. Finish reading first. Then start.

RULE 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE OPERATOR'S INTENT
These instructions say exactly what to do. Execute them exactly as written.
- Do NOT reinterpret steps
- Do NOT "improve" the instructions
- Do NOT skip steps because they seem unnecessary
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the document
- Do NOT change the order of steps
If a step says do X, do X. Not Y. Not a better version of X. X.

RULE 3: NEVER MODIFY THESE WITHOUT PERMISSION
- API keys - copy them exactly, character for character
- Terminal commands - run them exactly as written, no edits
- Config values - use the exact values specified
- Model names - use the exact names specified, spelling matters
- File paths - use the exact paths specified
If you are unsure whether something should be changed, the answer is NO.
Ask the operator. Do not guess. Do not assume.

RULE 4: BUILD YOUR CHECKLIST BEFORE EXECUTING
Before you run a single command or make a single change, create a numbered
checklist of every action this document requires you to take. Write it out.
Show it to the user before starting. Get confirmation. Then execute.

RULE 5: CHECK YOURSELF AGAINST THE CHECKLIST WHEN DONE
When you believe you are finished, go back to your checklist.
Verify every single item was completed. Check it off explicitly.
If anything was missed, complete it before telling the user you are done.
Do NOT tell the user you are done until the checklist is 100% complete.

RULE 6: REPORT WHAT YOU DID
When finished, give the user a clear summary:
- What was completed
- What commands were run
- What files were changed
- Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the checklist was fully satisfied

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPENCLAW SETUP - ADD KIE.AI API KEY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://kie.ai
2. Create an account
3. Navigate to API Settings
4. Generate an API key
5. Add credits (pay-as-you-go)

STEP 2: Add to OpenClaw Config
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

Add under "env" section:
{
  "env": {
    "vars": {
      "KIE_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
    }
  }
}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL: CORRECT API ENDPOINTS
KIE.ai uses DIFFERENT endpoints than OpenAI!

| Action       | Method | Endpoint |
| Create Image | POST   | https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask |
| Check Status | GET    | https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=XXX |
| Create Video | POST   | https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/veo/generate |
| Video Status | GET    | https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/veo/task?taskId=XXX |

WRONG - NEVER USE: /v1/images/generations (that is OpenAI format, not KIE.ai)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SELF-TEST: VERIFY KIE.AI IS WORKING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
After setup, run these tests to confirm everything works:

TEST 1: Verify API Key Exists
echo $KIE_API_KEY | head -c 10
Expected: First 10 characters of your key

TEST 2: Test Image Generation
curl -s -X POST "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "nano-banana-pro",
    "input": {
      "prompt": "A simple red circle on white background",
      "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
      "resolution": "1K"
    }
  }'
Expected response:
{
  "taskId": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "status": "processing"
}

TEST 3: Poll for Result
curl -s "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=YOUR_TASK_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY"
Expected: status "completed" with resultUrls array

SELF-TEST CHECKLIST:
- API key is in config (check env.vars.KIE_API_KEY)
- Can reach api.kie.ai (curl test)
- Can create a test image task
- Can poll and get result URL
- Result URL returns valid image
DO NOT tell user setup is complete until all tests pass.

Polling best practices
Prefer callbacks with callBackUrl in production.
Initial polls first 30 seconds: every 2 to 3 seconds.
After 30 seconds: every 5 to 10 seconds.
After 2 minutes: every 15 to 30 seconds.
Stop after 10 to 15 minutes and investigate.
Use exponential backoff to reduce load.
On success, parse resultJson, download results immediately, and store them. Generated URLs typically expire after 24 hours.
Kling 3.0 (kling-3.0/video)
Source: https://docs.kie.ai/market/kling/kling-3.0.md
Overview
Kling 3.0 is a video generation model that supports text to video and image to video in a single endpoint. It can run in single-shot or multi-shot mode, supports element references, optional sound effects, and 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 aspect ratios.
Pricing and credits
The Kling 3.0 doc does not list per generation credit costs. The general pricing page is https://kie.ai/pricing, but it does not expose Kling 3.0 credit costs in the markdown docs. You must check the KIE market pricing page for current credits per generation.
Modes supported
Text to video - single-shot
Image to video - single-shot using image_urls (first frame or first and last frame)
Multi-shot video - multi_prompt array, with optional first frame in image_urls[0]

std is standard resolution
pro is higher resolution
aspect_ratio: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1
If image_urls are provided, aspect_ratio is ignored and output follows the image ratio
Model specific constraints
multi_shots true requires sound true
If you reference @element_name in prompt, kling_elements must include that element
For multi-shot, provide multi_prompt and each item must include prompt and duration
image_urls only supports JPG, JPEG, PNG
element images must be at least 300 x 300 px and max 10 MB each
