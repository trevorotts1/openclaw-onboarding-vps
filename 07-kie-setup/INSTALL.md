  MANDATORY TYP CHECK - READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
  DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS CHECK IS COMPLETE.
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP 1: CHECK IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE TEACH YOURSELF PROTOCOL (TYP)

Before you read, learn, or execute ANY instruction in this document, you must
verify that you have already been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP).

HOW TO CHECK:
- Look in your AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or MEMORY.md for any mention of:
  "Teach Yourself Protocol" or "TYP"
- Look in your session context for prior TYP training
- Look for a tab called "Teach Yourself Protocol" in this same document

IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
Proceed to the instructions below. Follow the TYP file storage structure.

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further. Do not attempt to learn or execute
anything in this document. Tell the user exactly this:

  "I have not been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol yet. I cannot safely
   learn or execute these instructions until I have been taught TYP first.
   Please share the Teach Yourself Protocol tab with me before we proceed.
   Without TYP, I will bloat your core .md files and waste your tokens."

DO NOT PROCEED PAST THIS POINT WITHOUT TYP CONFIRMED.

CONFLICT RULE (applies to all skill installs):
If this skill's SKILL.md, CORE_UPDATES.md, or any other file in this skill
folder conflicts with TYP regarding WHICH core .md files to update or WHAT
content to add, always follow this skill's files. The skill takes precedence
over TYP on core file update decisions. TYP governs the storage method (lean
summaries + file paths). The skill governs the content and which files it
touches. When in doubt: skill docs win.


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  TYP FILE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS (only read this if TYP confirmed)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHEN LEARNING THIS DOCUMENT, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:

1. SAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION TO MASTER FILES FOLDER
   Find the OpenClaw master files folder in ~/Downloads/. It may be named:
   - OpenClaw Master Files
   - OpenClaw Master Documents
   - OpenClaw Documents
   - openclaw-master-files
   - openclaw master files
   - OpenClaw Files
   - openclaw-documents
   - Any variation of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents"
   Search case-insensitively. One word or two words. Plural or singular.
   If no folder is found, create: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/

   Save this full document content as a .md file in that folder.
   Example: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/kie-ai-reference.md

2. DO NOT DUMP FULL CONTENT INTO CORE .MD FILES
   AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md must stay lean.
   Only add a brief summary and a file path reference to where the full
   documentation lives. Never paste thousands of lines into core files.

3. USE THE LABELED SECTIONS BELOW TO KNOW WHAT GOES WHERE
   Look for sections marked:
   [ADD TO AGENTS.md]
   [ADD TO TOOLS.md]
   [ADD TO MEMORY.md]
   Only add what is labeled. Nothing else goes into core files.

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY BEFORE YOU START
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

These rules apply every single time you execute instructions from this document.
No exceptions. No shortcuts. No improvising.

RULE 1: READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Read this entire document from top to bottom before executing a single step.
Do not start executing while still reading. Finish reading first. Then start.

RULE 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE OPERATOR'S INTENT
These instructions say exactly what to do. Execute them exactly as written.
- Do NOT reinterpret steps
- Do NOT "improve" the instructions
- Do NOT skip steps because they seem unnecessary
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the document
- Do NOT change the order of steps
If a step says do X, do X. Not Y. Not a better version of X. X.

RULE 3: NEVER MODIFY THESE WITHOUT PERMISSION
- API keys - copy them exactly, character for character
- Terminal commands - run them exactly as written, no edits
- Config values - use the exact values specified
- Model names - use the exact names specified, spelling matters
- File paths - use the exact paths specified
If you are unsure whether something should be changed, the answer is NO.
Ask the operator. Do not guess. Do not assume.

RULE 4: BUILD YOUR CHECKLIST BEFORE EXECUTING
Before you run a single command or make a single change, create a numbered
checklist of every action this document requires you to take. Write it out.
Show it to the user before starting. Get confirmation. Then execute.

RULE 5: CHECK YOURSELF AGAINST THE CHECKLIST WHEN DONE
When you believe you are finished, go back to your checklist.
Verify every single item was completed. Check it off explicitly.
If anything was missed, complete it before telling the user you are done.
Do NOT tell the user you are done until the checklist is 100% complete.

RULE 6: REPORT WHAT YOU DID
When finished, give the user a clear summary:
- What was completed
- What commands were run
- What files were changed
- Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the checklist was fully satisfied

KIE.AI SETUP - INSTALLATION GUIDE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: CREATE KIE.AI ACCOUNT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Navigate to https://kie.ai

2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started".

3. Create account using email and password, or "Continue with Google".

4. If email signup: check inbox for verification email from KIE.ai. Click the verification link.

5. Log in. Verify dashboard is visible.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: ADD CREDITS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. Navigate to https://kie.ai/pricing

7. Select a credit amount ($10-$20 recommended for initial setup).

8. Enter payment information and complete purchase.

9. Verify credit balance updated on dashboard.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: GENERATE API KEY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

10. Navigate to https://kie.ai/api-key

11. Click "Create API Key" or "Generate New Key".

12. Retrieve the API key from the page. It is shown only once.

13. Store the API key. If the page is closed before copying, delete that key and create a new one.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 4: ADD API KEY TO OPENCLAW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

14. Check ~/clawd/secrets/.env for KIE_API_KEY. If found, skip to Step 6.
    If not found, request the API key from user.

15. Open ~/clawd/secrets/.env (create the file if it does not exist).
    Add this line at the end:

    KIE_API_KEY=paste-your-actual-api-key-here

    Replace "paste-your-actual-api-key-here" with the actual key value.
    Save the file.

16. Run:

    openclaw gateway restart

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 5: SET UP WEBHOOK (OPTIONAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

18. Navigate to https://kie.ai/settings

19. Locate the "Webhook" section.

20. If webhooks are desired, retrieve the "webhookHmacKey" value and store it for later use.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 6: VERIFY SETUP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TEST 1: Reload environment and verify API key is loaded.

21. First, reload the environment so the newly written key is available:

    source ~/clawd/secrets/.env 2>/dev/null || source ~/.openclaw/.env 2>/dev/null || true

22. Run:

    echo $KIE_API_KEY | head -c 10

    Verify output shows the first 10 characters of the API key.
    If blank, the key was not saved correctly. Return to Step 4.

TEST 2: Check credit balance.

23. Run:

    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY" \
      "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/chat/credit"

    Verify response contains {"code":200,"msg":"success","data":<number>}.
    If 401 error, the API key is invalid. Return to Step 3 and generate a new one.

TEST 3: Generate a test image.

24. Run:

    curl -s -X POST "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "nano-banana-pro",
        "input": {
          "prompt": "A simple red circle on white background",
          "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
          "resolution": "1K"
        }
      }'

    Verify response includes a "taskId" and a status. If error, check API key and credit balance.

TEST 4: Verify test image completed.

25. Wait 10-15 seconds. Run (replace YOUR_TASK_ID with the taskId from Test 3):

    curl -s "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=YOUR_TASK_ID" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $KIE_API_KEY"

    Verify response shows status "success" and includes result URLs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SETUP CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before telling the user that setup is complete, verify ALL of these:

[ ] KIE.ai account created
[ ] Credits added to the account
[ ] API key generated and copied
[ ] API key saved to ~/clawd/secrets/.env as KIE_API_KEY

## 🔴 GATEWAY RESTART PROTOCOL - NEVER TRIGGER AUTONOMOUSLY

**During this installation, you may encounter instructions to restart the OpenClaw gateway.**

**YOU ARE FORBIDDEN from triggering gateway restarts yourself.**

### Correct Process
When a gateway restart is needed:
1. **STOP** - Do NOT execute the restart command
2. **NOTIFY** the user: "This installation requires an OpenClaw gateway restart to complete."
3. **INSTRUCT**: "Type `/restart` in Telegram to trigger it"
4. **WAIT** for user action - do NOT proceed until confirmed

### Forbidden Actions
- Do NOT run `openclaw gateway restart` without explicit user permission
- Do NOT say "I will restart the gateway now" without asking first
- Do NOT assume the user wants the restart
