# Social Media Planner / Content Publishing Engine — Execution Instructions

**Version:** v10.12.0 (closes Audit Phase 11 — INSTRUCTIONS.md was missing)
**Skill:** 35-social-media-planner (a.k.a. Content Publishing Engine)
**Status:** Required runtime guide. Referenced from `SKILL.md` as part of the TYP read-order.

This is the **execution guide** for the 15+6 agent content publishing pipeline. `INSTALL.md` covers one-time setup; `SKILL.md` describes purpose. **This file covers how an agent actually runs a publishing cycle.**

---

## What this skill does

Orchestrate 15 production agents + 6 QC agents to research, create, produce, schedule, and publish content across **8 platforms**: WordPress, Medium, Substack, LinkedIn articles, GHL blog, YouTube, X/Twitter, Facebook. Also handles HTML email newsletters and podcast distribution.

The skill is **variable-driven** — every credential, URL, brand voice, and image-model setting is pulled from existing files. **Never hardcode a brand name, a domain, or a credential.**

---

## TYP read-order (mandatory)

1. `SKILL.md` — what the skill is and the 15+6 agent roster
2. **`INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this file)** — how to execute a cycle
3. `INSTALL.md` — re-read only if a step refers back to install state
4. `QC.md` — runtime QC rubric (separate from install QC)
5. `CORE_UPDATES.md` — what gets written to core .md files after install
6. `references/` — platform-specific cheat sheets (read only the platform you're publishing to)

Skipping is an N4 violation.

## Variable sources (NEVER hardcode)

The skill resolves variables at runtime from these sources. Confirm each is present before launching a cycle:

| Variable type | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| Brand voice, tone, mission | `~/.openclaw/SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` |
| Owner profile, audience | `~/.openclaw/USER.md` |
| API keys (GHL, WordPress, Medium, etc.) | `~/.openclaw/credentials/.env` |
| Platform URLs, location IDs | `~/.openclaw/credentials/.env` (e.g., `GHL_LOCATION_ID`) |
| Image model preference | `~/.openclaw/config/image-model.json` |
| Video specs (resolution, bitrate) | `~/.openclaw/config/video-specs.json` |
| Posting cadence, time-of-day | `~/.openclaw/config/social-cadence.json` |

If any source is missing, **STOP** and surface the gap via the triple-fire trigger (N22). Do not invent a default.

## The 5-phase publishing cycle

### Phase 1 — Research & Strategy
**Agents:** Researcher, Strategist
**Inputs:** Topic (from user) OR upcoming-event signal (from calendar watcher)
**Outputs:** `strategy.md` with hooks, SEO targets, brand-voice-aligned angles

```
1. Researcher: memory_search + web_search on topic → raw data dump
2. Strategist: synthesizes into strategy.md, pulling voice from SOUL.md
```

### Phase 2 — Content Creation
**Agents:** Writer, Editor, Image Prompt Engineer, Image Generator, Video Script Writer, Audio Generator, Thumbnail Designer
**Outputs:** `article-draft.md`, `image-prompts.json`, generated images, `video-script.md`, audio files, thumbnails

```
1. Writer drafts → Editor refines
2. Image Prompt Engineer writes prompts → Image Generator produces images
3. (If video) Video Script Writer drafts → Audio Generator voices it → Thumbnail Designer makes the preview
```

### Phase 3 — Production
**Agents:** Video Producer (FFmpeg), Email Designer
**Outputs:** Final video files (with crossfades, intro/outro), HTML email body

FFmpeg pipeline reads specs from `~/.openclaw/config/video-specs.json` — do not pass resolution/bitrate as CLI args.

### Phase 4 — Schedule
**Agent:** Publisher (planning sub-step)
**Inputs:** Strategy + finished content + `social-cadence.json`
**Output:** `publish-schedule.json` (per-platform timestamps)

The Publisher does NOT post yet — it queues. The owner can review the schedule before Phase 5 fires.

### Phase 5 — Publish + Monitor
**Agents:** Publisher (per-platform), Podcast Publisher, Email Publisher, Engagement Monitor
**Outputs:** Live posts, metrics dashboard updates

Engagement Monitor runs continuously for 7 days post-publish; results flow into `~/.openclaw/data/engagement/<run-id>.json`.

---

## QC gates (the 6 QC agents)

Per N5, QC agents are **always different sub-agents than the producers**. They fire between phases:

| Gate | QC agent | Fires after | Blocks if |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Grammar | Grammar QC | Phase 2 (writer) | Score < 8.5 |
| Fact-check | Fact-Check QC | Phase 2 (writer) | Any claim unsourced |
| Visual | Visual QC | Phase 2/3 (image + video) | Brand-alignment fail |
| Compliance | Compliance QC | Before Phase 5 | Any legal/brand flag |
| Performance | Performance QC | Phase 3 | SEO score < threshold |
| Final | Final QC | Right before publish | Composite < 8.5 |

Max 5 retry loops per gate (N6). Loop 6 → escalate to owner via Telegram.

## How to trigger this skill

### Single-topic cycle:

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/35-social-media-planner/scripts/run-publishing-cycle.sh \
  --topic "How to delegate to AI without losing control" \
  --platforms "linkedin,medium,x,wordpress" \
  --schedule "auto"
```

### Recurring (cron-driven, e.g., weekly):

```bash
0 9 * * 1 bash ~/.openclaw/skills/35-social-media-planner/scripts/weekly-batch.sh
```

The weekly batch reads `~/.openclaw/config/content-calendar.json` and runs the 5-phase cycle for each scheduled topic.

### From the dashboard:

The Marketing department in the dashboard has a "Publish" button on each campaign. Clicking it queues a cycle for this skill.

## Platform-specific gotchas

| Platform | Cheat-sheet |
|----------|-------------|
| WordPress | Uses XML-RPC. Confirm `WP_XMLRPC_URL` in `.env`. References: `references/wordpress.md` |
| Medium | One post per day cap. Publisher auto-rate-limits. |
| Substack | Email-out happens server-side; we only publish the post. |
| LinkedIn | Article API requires a verified Business Page token. |
| GHL blog | Posts via the LeadConnector API. Respect daily quota — pre-check via `~/.openclaw/scripts/ghl-quota-check.sh` first (see cron-prompt RULE 18). |
| YouTube | Video Producer's output must be H.264 / AAC. Specs in `video-specs.json`. |
| X / Twitter | Thread mode: posts longer than 280 chars are auto-threaded. |
| Facebook | Page token only; personal profile posting is not supported. |

---

## Failure modes and recovery

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Image Generator errors on every prompt | Image model in `image-model.json` deprecated | Update the config to a current model (see N1 — non-Anthropic only) |
| Video Producer hangs at "encoding" | FFmpeg missing or wrong codec | `ffmpeg -version`; install if missing; verify codec in `video-specs.json` |
| Final QC keeps failing for "brand voice mismatch" | `SOUL.md` voice profile drifted | Re-read SOUL.md in the Strategist agent; do not patch in the writer |
| GHL post returns 429 | Daily quota exhausted | Stop, check quota, wait until reset clock (see cron-prompt RULE 18) |
| Posts publish but engagement is 0 | Wrong audience hour from `social-cadence.json` | Re-read cadence; A/B test alternate slot |

---

## Reporting connection status — LIVE GHL CHECK ONLY (no guessing)
Before you tell the owner which platforms are or are not connected, you MUST run a LIVE query of their GHL Social Planner connected accounts (via the GHL API for the client's location). You may NOT say "connected" or "not connected" for any channel without that live result. Reporting connection status from an assumption, from the absence of a direct-platform token in the vault, or from memory is a BANNED failure (it is exactly the mistake that told a client "nothing is connected" when their GHL Social Planner had channels live).
- GHL Social Planner is the PRIMARY publishing path. The client connects their social accounts inside GHL, and you publish through GHL. ONE connected channel is enough to start. The client does NOT need all platforms.
- The direct-publish destinations (WordPress, Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, YouTube, X/Twitter, Facebook, email newsletter) are OPTIONAL add-ons for posting outside GHL. They are NEVER requirements, and their absence NEVER blocks Skill 35.
- Fish Audio / podcast (Skill 30) is OPTIONAL too. Skill 35 runs fully without it, it just skips podcast production.
- Run the check-social-connections step (the live GHL query) at status time, every time, and report only what it returns.

### check-social-connections step (live GHL query)

Every time you report on connection status, run this step first. Choose the path that matches your routing mode (detected in INSTALL.md Step 4):

**MCP-first (Skill 36 installed):**
```bash
# Tier 2 community MCP — get_platform_accounts returns all connected channels
curl -sS -m 10 -X POST "$GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"get_platform_accounts","arguments":{}}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Direct API (Skill 36 NOT installed):**
```bash
# GHL Social Planner OAuth accounts — one call per platform you want to check
for platform in facebook instagram linkedin twitter google youtube tiktok; do
  printf "\n── $platform ──\n"
  curl -sS -m 10 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY" \
    -H "Version: 2021-07-28" \
    "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/social-media-posting/oauth/$GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID/${platform}/accounts"
done
```

Report ONLY what these live calls return. If the API is unreachable, say "GHL Social Planner API unreachable — cannot determine connection status" and surface the error. Never substitute a guess.

---

## Weekly trigger — CRON, not heartbeat (enforcement)
The weekly content-theme question and the weekly social-planning run MUST be driven by a hard cron, NOT the heartbeat checklist. Heartbeat timing drifts and silently skips the weekly prompt (this is exactly why a client's Saturday theme question never fired). At activation, install a weekly cron (default Saturday 8:00 AM client-local time) that (a) asks the owner the content-theme question and (b) runs the weekly social plan, backed by a state field so it is idempotent and catches up if a fire is missed. Do NOT rely on heartbeat prose for any weekly trigger.

The HEARTBEAT.md Saturday theme-request entry (installed in INSTALL.md Step 9) is superseded by this cron for timing enforcement. Heartbeat remains as a fallback acknowledgement only.

### Cron registration (VPS — Hostinger Docker container context)

VPS OpenClaw runs in Docker. Crons MUST be registered via `openclaw cron add` (the gateway cron store). Writing to `.cron.jobs` JSON config does NOT validate on 2026.5.27+. Use the same pattern as Skill 38's `04-register-crons.sh`.

Run `scripts/register-weekly-cron.sh` during activation, OR register manually:

```bash
# Idempotent — check first, then register
openclaw cron list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "skill35-weekly-theme" || \
  openclaw cron add \
    --name "skill35-weekly-theme" \
    --cron "0 8 * * 6" \
    --agent main \
    --message "Skill 35 weekly trigger: Ask the owner what content theme they want for the coming week. After they reply (or after 1 hour with no reply, use 'evergreen'), run the weekly social media planning cycle: read ~/.openclaw/config/content-calendar.json, fire run-publishing-cycle.sh for all topics due this week. Check state marker /tmp/skill35-weekly-theme-$(date +%Y%U).done before acting — if it exists, the week's theme request already fired; skip gracefully. After completing, write that marker file." \
    --light-context \
    --announce \
    --channel last \
    --best-effort-deliver
```

**State/marker file:** `/tmp/skill35-weekly-theme-<YEAR><WEEK>.done` (e.g., `/tmp/skill35-weekly-theme-202624.done`). The cron message instructs the agent to check and write this file so the trigger is idempotent even if OpenClaw fires the cron more than once in a week.

**Validate config is still clean after registering:**
```bash
openclaw config validate
```

## When to invoke this skill

**Always:**
- Owner asks for a post / video / newsletter
- Calendar watcher fires (recurring schedule)
- Campaign in the dashboard transitions to "Publish" state

**Never:**
- For ad copy (that's Skill 36 — Paid Ads)
- For one-off internal memos (those go via Slack/Telegram, not the publishing pipeline)
- When any QC gate above is open from a previous cycle (resolve first)
