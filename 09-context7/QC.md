# QC Checklist - Skill 09: Context7
**Version:** v6.5.6

Run this after installation. Every section must pass before you mark Context7 complete.

---

## 1. File and version checks

Confirm the onboarding folder is intact and the version file matches this checklist.

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/data/Downloads/openclaw-master-files/OpenClaw Onboarding/09-context7"
ls -1 "$SKILL_DIR"
cat "$SKILL_DIR/skill-version.txt"
```

- [ ] `SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `CORE_UPDATES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `context7-full.md`, `QC.md`, and `skill-version.txt` all exist
- [ ] `skill-version.txt` returns `v6.5.6`
- [ ] `context7-full.md` is non-empty

**PASS:** All files exist and the version matches.

---

## 2. Core file update checks

Verify the lean summaries were added without dumping the whole skill into core files.

```bash
grep -n "Context7" /data/openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md /data/openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md /data/openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md
```

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` mentions Context7 as a docs lookup tool and says to use it before coding against external APIs
- [ ] `TOOLS.md` includes both endpoints below:
  - `https://api.context7.com/v1/search?q=<library>`
  - `https://api.context7.com/v1/libraries/<id>/context`
- [ ] `MEMORY.md` contains a short reminder, not a pasted copy of the full skill
- [ ] Forbidden files such as `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, and `USER.md` were not edited for this skill

**PASS:** All three core files contain short, correct references only.

---

## 3. Secret storage checks

Context7 is API-only. There is no CLI install for this skill.

```bash
printenv CONTEXT7_API_KEY | sed 's/./*/g' | head -c 8; echo
grep -n '^CONTEXT7_API_KEY=' /data/openclaw/workspace/secrets/.env 2>/dev/null
```

- [ ] A `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` exists in environment or secrets storage
- [ ] Stored key starts with `ctx7sk-`
- [ ] Key is not committed into repo files or pasted into core docs
- [ ] No one installed or relied on a fake `context7` CLI for setup

**PASS:** A valid-looking key exists and the skill stays API-only.

---

## 4. Functional API tests

Run the real lookup flow the skill depends on.

### 4A. Search test
```bash
source /data/openclaw/workspace/secrets/.env 2>/dev/null || true
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTEXT7_API_KEY"   "https://api.context7.com/v1/search?q=react" | jq '.results[0]'
```

- [ ] Returns JSON, not HTML or an auth error
- [ ] `.results[0].id` is non-null
- [ ] `.results[0].name` is non-empty

### 4B. Fetch docs test
Use the ID from the search result above.
```bash
LIB_ID="<paste-library-id-here>"
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTEXT7_API_KEY"   "https://api.context7.com/v1/libraries/$LIB_ID/context" | jq 'keys'
```

- [ ] Request succeeds with HTTP 200 behavior
- [ ] Response contains documentation content, not `401`, `403`, or empty output
- [ ] This confirms the full search -> fetch-docs flow works

**PASS:** Both API calls succeed.

---

## 5. Failure conditions

Mark this skill FAIL if any of these are true:

- [ ] `skill-version.txt` does not match `v6.5.6`
- [ ] `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is missing or malformed
- [ ] Search works but docs fetch fails
- [ ] Core files are bloated with copied full-doc content
- [ ] Installer relied on a Context7 CLI even though this skill is API-only

---

## Final pass rule

Pass this skill only if all of the following are true:

- [ ] File set is complete
- [ ] Version matches `v6.5.6`
- [ ] Core file summaries are lean and correct
- [ ] `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is stored correctly
- [ ] Search and docs fetch both work with the real API
