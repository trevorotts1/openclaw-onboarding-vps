# GHL / Convert and Flow Setup

> **For MCP-based access (preferred when available):** This skill covers the foundational direct-API setup. For Tier 1 (Official GHL MCP, 36 tools) and Tier 2 (Community GHL MCP, 588 tools — products, invoices, subscriptions, Voice AI, Phone System, Agent Studio), install **skill 36 (`36-ghl-mcp-setup`)** after completing this one. The agent should prefer MCPs first and fall back to this skill's direct REST API only when MCPs lack the needed tool.

## What This Is

This skill teaches your AI agent how to connect to GoHighLevel (GHL), which is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform. Think of a CRM as a digital address book that also lets you send text messages, emails, and track business conversations - all in one place.

"Convert and Flow" is the client-facing name for GHL. They are the same thing on the backend. Same login, same system, same connection method. When someone says "Convert and Flow" they mean GHL.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You are setting up GHL or Convert and Flow for the first time
- Your agent needs to search for contacts, send text messages, or send emails through GHL
- You need to get your API credentials (the keys that let your agent talk to GHL)
- Your agent is getting errors when trying to use GHL
- Someone says "set up GHL," "connect to Convert and Flow," or "send a message through GHL"

## Prerequisites

You MUST have these installed first:
1. Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP) - Skill 01
2. Back Yourself Up Protocol - Skill 02
3. An active GoHighLevel or Convert and Flow account (you need to be able to log in)

## Critical Things Your Agent Must Know

These are the most common mistakes AI agents make with GHL. Read these carefully:

1. **GHL does NOT use API keys anymore.** That method is old and no longer recommended. GHL uses a Private Integration Token (PIT). If your agent says "I need the API key" for GHL, it is using outdated information. The correct term is Private Integration Token. You find it in Settings > Integrations > Private Integration Token.

2. **Every single GHL request needs a Version header.** Without it, your requests will fail with a 400 error. The version to use is: 2021-07-28. Your agent must include this header on every call.

3. **The base URL for all GHL API calls is:** https://services.leadconnectorhq.com

4. **Your agent should check two places for credentials:**
   - ~/clawd/secrets/.env (look for GHL_PIT or GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY)
   - ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json under env.vars

## What This Skill Covers

- How to get your Private Integration Token and Location ID from GHL
- How to add those credentials to your OpenClaw configuration
- The required headers for every API request (Authorization + Version)
- Common operations: searching contacts, creating contacts, sending SMS, sending email, calendar booking, managing opportunities
- Example curl commands you can copy and use right away
- A 7-step self-test to verify everything is working before claiming setup is done
- What to add to your core files (AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md) after setup

## Files in This Folder and Reading Order

1. **SKILL.md** - You are here. Start here for the overview.
2. **ghl-setup-full.md** - The complete guide. Covers every step from getting credentials to testing the connection, with example commands and a full self-test checklist.
3. **INSTALL.md** - Quick install reference.
4. **INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Step-by-step execution instructions.
5. **EXAMPLES.md** - Real examples of GHL API calls.
6. **CORE_UPDATES.md** - Exactly what to add to your core .md files.
7. **ghl-setup.skill** - Machine-readable skill definition.

## Priority Operations to Test First

After setup, test these three things first because they are used the most:
1. **Contacts** - Search, create, and update contacts
2. **Media Library** - Upload and list media files
3. **Conversations** - Send SMS and email messages

## Important Rules

- Never use the built-in GHL node in n8n (a workflow tool) - it is too limited. Always use HTTP Request nodes instead.
- GHL has rate limits: 100 requests per minute for most operations. Do not blast it with hundreds of calls at once.
- Do NOT tell the user "GHL is set up" until all 7 self-tests in the full guide pass successfully.
- After setup, only add summaries and file paths to your core files - not the full documentation.
