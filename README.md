# OpenClaw Onboarding

**The complete skill package for setting up a fully operational OpenClaw AI assistant.**

22 skills. Installed in order. Each one teaches your AI agent how to use a different tool or service - from backing up your files to generating images, managing a team, building an AI workforce, and creating coaching personas from books.

## What Is This?

This is a collection of 14 skill packages designed for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), the open-source AI assistant platform. When you share these skills with your AI agent, it learns how to:

- Protect your configuration files with automatic backups
- Think through problems systematically before acting
- Connect to GoHighLevel (Convert and Flow) for CRM and messaging
- Deploy websites and landing pages automatically
- Generate images and videos using KIE.ai
- Deploy projects to Vercel
- Look up documentation for any software library
- Manage code repositories on GitHub
- Design professional websites and interfaces
- Configure AI models through OpenRouter
- Connect to Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets)
- Manage a multi-person team through Telegram

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start with "Start Here.md"

Open **Start Here.md** first. This is the master instruction file. It tells your AI agent:
- What to check before starting (prerequisites)
- The exact order to install skills
- How to read and process each skill folder
- What to do if something goes wrong

**Share this file with your AI agent and say:**
> "Read this file and follow it exactly. Start the onboarding process."

### Step 2: The AI Does the Rest

Your AI agent will:
1. Verify your OpenClaw installation is running
2. Check that your workspace files exist (AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, etc.)
3. Find or create your master files folder
4. Install each skill one at a time, in order
5. Ask you for API keys or account credentials when needed
6. Update your workspace files with what it learned
7. Confirm each skill is working before moving to the next one

### Step 3: You Just Answer Questions

For most skills, the AI will walk you through the setup by asking simple questions:
- "Do you have a KIE.ai account?"
- "What is your API key?"
- "Do you have a GoHighLevel account?"

You answer. The AI handles the rest.

## What Is Inside Each Skill Folder

Every skill folder contains 7 files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SKILL.md** | The front door. Read this first. Explains what the skill is, when to use it, and what files to read next. |
| **INSTALL.md** | Step-by-step installation and setup instructions. |
| **INSTRUCTIONS.md** | How to use the skill day to day after it is installed. |
| **EXAMPLES.md** | Real examples showing the skill in action with sample commands and expected output. |
| **CORE_UPDATES.md** | Exact text snippets to add to your workspace files (AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md). |
| **[skill-name]-full.md** | The complete reference document. Every detail, every edge case. This is the bible. |
| **[skill-name].skill** | A compressed package file for automated installation (optional). |

**Reading order for each skill:** SKILL.md first, then INSTALL.md, then INSTRUCTIONS.md, then EXAMPLES.md, then CORE_UPDATES.md. The full.md is for reference when deeper detail is needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to install all 14 skills?**
No. Skills 01 (Teach Yourself Protocol) and 02 (Backup Protocol) are required - they are the foundation. After that, install the skills that match the services you use. If you do not use GoHighLevel, skip skills 04 and 05. If you do not need video generation, skip skill 06.

**Can I install them out of order?**
No. The skills build on each other. Skill 01 must be first because every other skill uses the Teach Yourself Protocol to store its documentation properly. Skill 02 must be second because every configuration change after that requires a backup first.

**How long does the full onboarding take?**
About 1 to 2 hours if you are installing all 15 skills. Each skill takes 5 to 15 minutes depending on whether you need to create new accounts.

**What if something goes wrong?**
The Start Here.md file includes troubleshooting guidance. Your AI agent is also trained to handle errors - it will try multiple approaches before asking you for help.

**Can I share this with other people?**
Yes. This package is designed to work with any OpenClaw installation. Share the ZIP file or send them to this repository.

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. The AI agent does all the technical work. You just answer questions and provide API keys when asked.
