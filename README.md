# OpenClaw Onboarding

**A complete onboarding package for setting up a fully operational OpenClaw agent.**

**Current Version: v9.0.0** — See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new.

This repo contains **36 skill folders** (01 through 36, with 13, 33, and 34 archived) plus an install script.

### What's New in v9.0.0 (May 13, 2026) — GHL MCP Multi-Tier Access
- **New skill 36 (`36-ghl-mcp-setup`)**: Installs a 5-tier GHL access chain — Official MCP (36 tools), Community MCP (588 tools, BusyBee3333 2026 fork), direct REST API (skill 29), Playwright browser, Codex Computer Use. The agent tries each tier in order before falling through.
- **`$GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL` env var**: Removes the agent's ability to hardcode wrong port numbers — documented past failures (port 8000 / 8765 confusion) eliminated by design.
- **Cardinal Tier Escalation Protocol added to SOUL.md template**: Tier order is binding; "session memory is not authoritative — the canonical state block is"; mandatory `[GHL tier used: N — tool_name]` disclosure header on every GHL response.
- **systemd unit (Linux/VPS) lifecycle**: No Docker dependency. Server auto-starts at boot, restarts on crash.
- **20-assertion QC script (`qc-ghl-setup.sh`)**: Exit 0 gate before declaring setup complete. Covers credentials, both MCPs, core file wiring, security.
- **Credential canonical path migrated in skill 05**: From `~/clawd/secrets/.env` to `/data/.openclaw/secrets/.env` (VPS canonical) to align with AGENTS.md operating rules.
- **Skill 35 routes GHL operations through MCPs first**: Social posting, blog publish, media upload, campaign scheduling all check `social-media-posting_create-post` (Tier 1) and `create_social_post` (Tier 2) before falling to raw API.
- **Skill 29 SKILL.md updated**: Now explicitly identifies itself as Tier 3 of the 5-tier chain, points readers to skill 36 for the MCP layer.
- **README skill inventory fully resynced**: Previous inventory had stale entries (`32-blackceo-voice-call-plugin`, missing `34-intelligent-staffing-ARCHIVED`). Real on-disk folders now reflected.

### What's New in v8.0.0 (April 13, 2026) — BlackCEO System Overhaul v3.3
- **Persona runtime loader**: Replaces hardcoded PERSONA_DETAILS with dynamic runtime loading from company-config.json
- **Grade formula updated**: New 40/30/15/15 weighting (Revenue 40%, Mission 30%, Efficiency 15%, Team 15%)
- **company-config.json wired to CEO Board**: CEO Performance Board now reads directly from company configuration
- **Department Browser + Focus view**: New Kanban-style department browser with focused task views at `/ceo-board/[dept]/focus`
- **Task API department filtering**: All task endpoints support department-based filtering
- **SOP creation + Devil's Advocate**: Each department now has SOP templates with built-in Devil's Advocate review
- **303 hardcoded ~/clawd/ paths cleaned**: All paths now use configurable workspace variables
- **All ports standardized to 4000**: Consistent port configuration across all services
- **department-naming-map.json created**: Standardized department naming conventions
- **persona-selection-log template created**: Structured logging for persona selection decisions
- **Anti-staleness guards added**: Automatic detection and refresh of stale configuration data
- **Post-task persona verification**: Validation step confirms persona performance after task completion
- **Memory Wiki integration**: Full integration with OpenClaw Memory Wiki for persistent knowledge

### What's New in v6.0.7 (March 27, 2026)
- **Persona Matching Protocol**: Personas are now matched per-task at runtime, not assigned per-department at build time. New `persona-matching-protocol.md` documents the 5-layer alignment check (Mission, Values, Company Goals, Department Goals, Task Fit). Layers 1-2 run once at setup; Layers 3-5 run fresh every task.
- **persona-categories.json added to Skill 22**: 40 personas with 12 domain tags and 6 perspective tags for category-filtered matching.
- **Skill 23 governing-personas.md corrected**: Now a reference guide per role folder, not a static department assignment.
- **Skill 32 token-in-webhook-response architecture**: The tunnel token now comes directly in the webhook HTTP response. No more waiting for Trevor to forward a Telegram notification. Trevor still receives a backup Telegram notification.
- **Skill 32 cloudflared install built into process**: `create-tunnel.sh` auto-installs cloudflared (brew on Mac, curl on Linux) if not present.
- **Skill 32 simplified script**: `create-tunnel.sh` rewritten from 147 lines to 59. Calls webhook, captures token, saves to .env, starts PM2, verifies URL.
- **Skill 14 rewritten:** Google Workspace CLI (gws) replaces google-api.js and gog - single tool for Gmail and Workspace
- **Skill 23 fixed:** AI Workforce Blueprint now properly presents options A, B, C before asking questions
- **Skill 15 fixed:** BlackCEO Team Management now requires real Telegram IDs, not placeholders
- **Legacy retrieval fully replaced** with Google Gemini Embedding 2 across all skills and scripts
- **Onboarding watchdog** added: 10-minute stall detection, never-stop-early, progress reporting every 5 skills
- **Mandatory file reading protocol:** agent must read ALL .md files before installing any skill
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** added: complete checklist for adding/modifying skills
- **MIGRATION.md** added: step-by-step guide for existing Google Embedding 2 users to migrate to Gemini Embedding 2

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this one command on the target machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding/main/install.sh | bash
```

What it does:
1. Downloads the latest onboarding package
2. Copies skills into `~/.openclaw/skills/`
3. Installs Gemini Engine early (required by skill 22 and skill 23)
4. Asks for missing API keys with a skip option (does not block optional skills)
5. Prints the next step

---

## Next Step After Install

Open:

- `~/.openclaw/skills/Start Here.md`

That file is the master instruction file. It contains:
- prerequisites
- exact skill install order
- the required file read order per skill
- verification rules
- what to do on failures

**Total: 36 numbered skill folders** (33 active + 3 archived: 13, 33, 34).

> **Note:** The Voice Call Plugin (`@openclaw/voice-call`) is installed separately via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/voice-call`. It is NOT part of the onboarding skill sequence — installing it as a skill caused double-install conflicts.

## What Is Inside a Skill Folder

Each skill folder contains a subset of these files:
- `SKILL.md`
- `INSTALL.md`
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `EXAMPLES.md`
- `CORE_UPDATES.md`
- `*.skill` (the OpenClaw install descriptor)

Some skills also include:
- `*-full.md` (a full reference guide)
- `upstream-original/` (for imported skills)
- `scripts/`, `templates/`, `references/`

---

## Notes

- Gemini Engine is installed by `install.sh` before platform skills. There is no separate Gemini Engine skill folder.
- If you fork this repo for client delivery, update `install.sh` to point at your fork.
