# OpenClaw Onboarding

**A complete onboarding package for setting up a fully operational OpenClaw agent.**

**Current Version: v5.4.2** — See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new.

This repo contains **32 skill folders** (01 through 32, with 13 archived) plus an install script.

### What's New in v5.4.2 (March 19, 2026)
- **Skill 32 hardening** - approved Option C hostname pattern: `[company-slug]-[shortid]` for collision-safe client URLs

- Added 5-layer memory verification requirement for each department workspace

### What's New in v5.4.1 (March 19, 2026)

### What's New in v5.3.0 (March 19, 2026)

- **Two new departments:** Research (Chief Research Officer + 3 roles) and Communications (Chief Communications Officer + 3 roles)
- **All 17 departments now presented equally** - Removed the "optional" tier, clients choose which to keep

### What's New in v5.0.3 (March 19, 2026)
- **CRITICAL FIX:** memory.backend must be "builtin" not "gemini" to prevent gateway crash on restart

### What's New in v5.0.2 (March 19, 2026)
- **Client approval UX fixed** — non-interactive runs now explain why approval could not be collected
- **Exact 2-step rerun commands shown** so clients know exactly what to do next

### What's New in v5.0.1 (March 19, 2026)
- **update-skills.sh v3.0** — now works on any client machine with dynamic folder detection
- **Backup protocol built in** — backs up core files and config before updates
- **Approval workflow** — shows a plan and waits for explicit approval before changes
- **Verification step** — confirms the update completed and warns if a restart may be needed
- **Never restarts automatically** — user must trigger /restart manually if required

### What's New in v5.0.0 (March 19, 2026)
- **Skill 31: Upgraded Memory System** - 5-layer architecture (markdown files, improved flush, session indexing, Gemini Embedding 2 search, Mem0 auto-capture)

- **Skill 23 fixed:** AI Workforce Blueprint now properly presents options A, B, C before asking questions
- **Skill 15 fixed:** BlackCEO Team Management now requires real Telegram IDs, not placeholders
- **Legacy retrieval fully replaced** with Google Gemini Embedding 2 across all skills and scripts
- **Onboarding watchdog** added: 10-minute stall detection, never-stop-early, progress reporting every 5 skills
- **Mandatory file reading protocol:** agent must read ALL .md files before installing any skill
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** added: complete checklist for adding/modifying skills
- **MIGRATION.md** added: step-by-step guide for existing Google Embedding 2 users to migrate to Gemini Embedding 2

- Install happens in a strict order
- The agent executes the steps autonomously
- Humans only provide credentials, API keys, 2FA codes, and first time logins when required

## Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this one command on the target machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding/main/install.sh | bash
```

What it does:
1. Downloads the latest onboarding package
2. Copies skills into `~/.openclaw/skills/`
3. Installs Gemini Engine early (required by skill 22 and skill 23)
4. Asks for missing API keys with a skip option (does not block optional skills)
5. Prints the next step

---

## Next Step After Install

Open:

- `~/.openclaw/skills/Start Here.md`

That file is the master instruction file. It contains:
- prerequisites
- exact skill install order
- the required file read order per skill
- verification rules
- what to do on failures

> **Note:** The Voice Call Plugin (`@openclaw/voice-call`) is installed separately via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/voice-call`. It is NOT part of the onboarding skill sequence — installing it as a skill caused double-install conflicts.

## What Is Inside a Skill Folder

Each skill folder contains a subset of these files:
- `SKILL.md`
- `INSTALL.md`
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `EXAMPLES.md`
- `CORE_UPDATES.md`
- `*.skill` (the OpenClaw install descriptor)

Some skills also include:
- `*-full.md` (a full reference guide)
- `upstream-original/` (for imported skills)
- `scripts/`, `templates/`, `references/`

---

## Notes

- Gemini Engine is installed by `install.sh` before platform skills. There is no separate Gemini Engine skill folder.
- If you fork this repo for client delivery, update `install.sh` to point at your fork.
