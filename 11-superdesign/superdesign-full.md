  MANDATORY TYP CHECK - READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS CHECK IS COMPLETE.

STEP 1: CHECK IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE TEACH YOURSELF PROTOCOL (TYP)

Before you read, learn, or execute ANY instruction in this document, you must
verify that you have already been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP).

HOW TO CHECK:
- Look in your AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or MEMORY.md for any mention of:
  "Teach Yourself Protocol" or "TYP"
- Look in your session context for prior TYP training
- Look for a tab called "Teach Yourself Protocol" in this same document

IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
Proceed to the instructions below. Follow the TYP file storage structure.

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further. Do not attempt to learn or execute
anything in this document. Tell the user exactly this:

  "I have not been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol yet. I cannot safely
   learn or execute these instructions until I have been taught TYP first.
   Please share the Teach Yourself Protocol tab with me before we proceed.
   Without TYP, I will bloat your core .md files and waste your tokens."

DO NOT PROCEED PAST THIS POINT WITHOUT TYP CONFIRMED.

TYP FILE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS (only read this if TYP confirmed)

WHEN LEARNING THIS DOCUMENT, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:

1. SAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION TO MASTER FILES FOLDER
   Find the OpenClaw master files folder in /data/downloads/. It may be named:
   - OpenClaw Master Files
   - OpenClaw Master Documents
   - OpenClaw Documents
   - openclaw-master-files
   - openclaw master files
   - OpenClaw Files
   - openclaw-documents
   - Any variation of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents"
   Search case-insensitively. One word or two words. Plural or singular.
   If no folder is found, create: /data/downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/

   Save this full document content as a .md file in that folder.

2. DO NOT DUMP FULL CONTENT INTO CORE .MD FILES
   AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md must stay lean.
   Only add a brief summary and a file path reference to where the full
   documentation lives. Never paste thousands of lines into core files.

3. USE THE LABELED SECTIONS BELOW TO KNOW WHAT GOES WHERE
   Look for sections marked:
   [ADD TO AGENTS.md]
   [ADD TO TOOLS.md]
   [ADD TO MEMORY.md]
   Only add what is labeled. Nothing else goes into core files.

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY BEFORE YOU START
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

These rules apply every single time you execute instructions from this document.
No exceptions. No shortcuts. No improvising.

RULE 1: READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Read this entire document from top to bottom before executing a single step.
Do not start executing while still reading. Finish reading first. Then start.

RULE 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE OPERATOR'S INTENT
These instructions say exactly what to do. Execute them exactly as written.
- Do NOT reinterpret steps
- Do NOT "improve" the instructions
- Do NOT skip steps because they seem unnecessary
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the document
- Do NOT change the order of steps
If a step says do X, do X. Not Y. Not a better version of X. X.

RULE 3: NEVER MODIFY THESE WITHOUT PERMISSION
- API keys - copy them exactly, character for character
- Terminal commands - run them exactly as written, no edits
- Config values - use the exact values specified
- Model names - use the exact names specified, spelling matters
- File paths - use the exact paths specified
If you are unsure whether something should be changed, the answer is NO.
Ask the operator. Do not guess. Do not assume.

RULE 4: BUILD YOUR CHECKLIST BEFORE EXECUTING
Before you run a single command or make a single change, create a numbered
checklist of every action this document requires you to take. Write it out.
Show it to the user before starting. Get confirmation. Then execute.

RULE 5: CHECK YOURSELF AGAINST THE CHECKLIST WHEN DONE
When you believe you are finished, go back to your checklist.
Verify every single item was completed. Check it off explicitly.
If anything was missed, complete it before telling the user you are done.
Do NOT tell the user you are done until the checklist is 100% complete.

RULE 6: REPORT WHAT YOU DID
When finished, give the user a clear summary:
- What was completed
- What commands were run
- What files were changed
- Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the checklist was fully satisfied

BEFORE YOU BEGIN: Teach Yourself Protocol Notice

This document triggers the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP). If you are an AI agent receiving this document, follow these instructions before doing anything else:

If you already know the Teach Yourself Protocol:
Execute it now. This document is your input. Follow the TYP decision tree: evaluate, assess size, store the deep file, write lightweight summaries, update core files, confirm to the user.

If you do NOT know the Teach Yourself Protocol:
Stop. Ask your user: "Before I can properly learn this SuperDesign document, I need the Teach Yourself Protocol installed first. Can you teach me the Teach Yourself Protocol so I can retain this knowledge correctly?" Do not proceed until the TYP is installed. Without it, you will lose this knowledge next session.

Deep File Storage Path:
Save this entire document (untruncated, nothing removed) to:
/data/openclaw-master-files/superdesign/superdesign-instructions.md
If the openclaw-master-files folder does not exist, check /data/downloads/ for any similar folder (openclaw-docs, openclaw-master-docs, master-files). If nothing similar exists, create /data/openclaw-master-files/superdesign/ and save there.

Lightweight Summary Templates:
After storing the deep file, add these lightweight summaries to your core files:

SuperDesign.dev - The Everyday Person's Complete Guide
What Is SuperDesign, Really?
SuperDesign is an AI-powered design agent that helps you create website designs, UI layouts, wireframes, and components using plain English. You describe what you want, and it generates visual designs along with the actual code to build them.
Think of it like this: if you were building a house, SuperDesign is like an architect who draws up the blueprints AND gives you a construction-ready framework - but you still need to furnish the house (add your words, images, branding details, and content).

The Big Question: Does It Design, Build, or Both?
Here's the honest breakdown:
What SuperDesign DOES
Generates visual layouts - It creates the look and structure of your web pages (headers, footers, navigation menus, hero sections, feature grids, pricing tables, etc.)
Produces real code - Everything it designs comes with production-ready code. This is actual code a developer or AI coding tool can use.
Creates multiple design variations - You can generate multiple different versions of the same page in seconds and pick the one you like best.
Clones existing websites - Using the Chrome extension, you can capture any live website and bring it into SuperDesign as an editable starting point.
Exports code you can use - You can export your designs as React components, HTML files, or style guides that work with a wide range of tools (more on this below).
Handles responsive design - It generates layouts that work across desktop, tablet, and mobile automatically.
What SuperDesign DOES NOT Do
It does not write your copy - SuperDesign uses placeholder text or generic content. YOUR words, YOUR messaging, YOUR brand voice - that's on you (or your AI copywriter like Claude).
It does not source your images - It may place placeholder images, but your actual brand photos, headshots, and graphics need to be added separately.
It does not host your website - SuperDesign creates the design and code. You still need a hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, WordPress, Shopify, etc.) to put it live on the internet.
It does not handle backend functionality - Things like payment processing, email collection, login systems, databases - that's beyond what SuperDesign touches. It's focused on the visual front-end.
It does not replace a full website builder - It's not a drag-and-drop builder like Wix or Squarespace. It generates code-based designs that need to be implemented.

The Two Versions of SuperDesign
SuperDesign exists in two main forms. Understanding which one you're working with matters.
1. The Web App (app.superdesign.dev)
This is the browser-based version you access at superdesign.dev. It features:
A visual canvas where you can see and manipulate your designs
Chat-based design - you type what you want, and it generates it
Design Mode - generates polished, high-fidelity UI ready for production
Wireframe Mode - creates rough structural layouts from sketches or descriptions
Branching - create variations of any design to explore different directions
Flow generation - map out multi-page user journeys
Version history - go back to any previous version of your design
Export to code - get production-ready React code, HTML, or a style guide (style.md)
Shopify theme creation - can generate Shopify-compatible themes directly
This is the version that works with the Chrome Extension for cloning websites. If you're not a developer working in a code editor daily, the web app is your best bet.
2. The IDE Extension (for Code Editors)
This version lives inside coding tools like VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf. It's designed for developers who want to generate designs without leaving their code editor.

Understanding What SuperDesign Exports (And How to Use It With ANY Tool)
This is the section most people get confused by, so let's get crystal clear. When you finish a design in SuperDesign and hit Export, you get three types of output. Understanding what each one is - and what tools can use it - changes everything.
Export Type 1: React Code
What it is: React is a popular JavaScript framework for building websites. SuperDesign generates clean React components with Tailwind CSS styling. This is structured, organized code that a developer or coding AI can use to build your actual website.
What tools can use it directly:
Cursor (AI code editor)
VS Code / Windsurf
Claude Code
Any developer working in a React/Next.js environment
Can OpenClaw use it? Not directly in the same way - but you can feed React code to OpenClaw and ask it to modify, refine, or implement it through its coding skills (more on this in the OpenClaw Integration section).
Can Claude (chat) use it? Yes. You can paste the exported React code right into a Claude conversation and ask Claude to modify it, add your content, convert it, or explain it.
Export Type 2: HTML + CSS (via style.md or direct export)
What it is: HTML and CSS are the foundational languages of every website on the internet. This is the most universal export option because literally any web tool, platform, or AI assistant can work with plain HTML and CSS.
What tools can use it:
OpenClaw - You can give OpenClaw the HTML files and ask it to modify them, add content, deploy them, or integrate them into your workflow
Claude (chat or Claude Code) - Paste HTML into any Claude conversation and ask it to add your copy, change colors, restructure sections, whatever you need
ChatGPT - Same concept, paste the code and ask it to work with it
Any website builder that accepts custom code - WordPress (custom HTML blocks), Webflow, Squarespace (code injection), Wix (HTML embed)
Any developer or coding tool on earth - HTML/CSS is universal
This is your most flexible export option. If you're not sure which export to use, HTML is the safest bet because every tool and every AI assistant can work with it.
Export Type 3: style.md (The Design System Document)
What it is: This is a markdown file - basically a detailed written document - that captures every single design decision SuperDesign made. It includes your exact hex color codes, typography (font names, sizes, weights), spacing rules, button styles, component patterns, and more.
Why this matters so much: Even if you don't use the code export at all, the style.md is gold. You can hand this file to ANY AI tool and say "build me a website following these exact design specifications" and the AI will know exactly what your site should look like.
What tools can use it:
OpenClaw - Feed it the style.md as context and ask it to build pages following those design rules
Claude (any version) - Paste the style.md into your conversation and say "Here are my design specifications. Now build me a [landing page / about page / pricing page] using these exact styles."
ChatGPT - Same approach
Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf - Drop it into your project as a reference file
Any developer - This becomes their design bible
Any AI coding agent - They can all read markdown
The Bottom Line on Exports
You do NOT need Cursor, VS Code, or Claude Code to use SuperDesign's output. Here's the real truth:

Where SuperDesign Fits in YOUR Website Building Workflow
Here's the step-by-step process for how SuperDesign fits into building a website - whether you're using OpenClaw, Claude, or any other AI tool:
Step 1: Get Clear on What You Want (Before You Touch SuperDesign)
Before you open SuperDesign, you need:
Your brand colors (hex codes if you have them)
Your fonts (or at least a general feel - modern, elegant, bold, etc.)
A rough idea of your pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)
Your copy and messaging (or at least bullet points of what goes where)
Reference sites you admire (this is where the Chrome extension becomes gold)
Step 2: Use SuperDesign to Create the Visual Design
This is where SuperDesign does its thing. You have two approaches:
Approach A - Start from scratch: Open the SuperDesign web app and use the chat to describe what you want. Example prompts:
"Design a modern wellness coaching landing page with a hero section, testimonial carousel, three service cards, and an email signup"
"Create a dark, premium membership page with pricing tiers, FAQ accordion, and a bold call-to-action"
"Design a podcast page with episode listings, a featured episode player, and social media links"
Approach B - Clone a site you love (using the Chrome Extension): See the detailed walkthrough in the Cloning section below.
Step 3: Generate Multiple Versions (see "How to Control Variations" section below)
Step 4: Refine and Iterate Inside SuperDesign
Once you have a starting design, use the chat to make changes:
"Make the hero section taller with more breathing room"
"Change the color scheme to deep plum and gold"
"Add a testimonial section between the services and the footer"
"Make this feel more premium and luxurious"
Step 5: Export Your Design
When you're happy, export. Grab both the code export (HTML or React, depending on your tools) AND the style.mdfile.
Step 6: Hand Off to Your AI Tool
This is the bridge step. Take your exports to whichever tool you use:
OpenClaw → Feed it the HTML + style.md and instruct it to build out the full site with your content
Claude (chat) → Paste the code + style.md and ask Claude to add your copy, images, and customize
Claude Code → Drop the files into your project and prompt Claude to refine
Cursor → Drop the React code into your project and iterate
ChatGPT → Paste and instruct
A developer → Hand them everything as a starting blueprint
Step 7: Add Your Content
Replace all placeholder content with your actual headlines, body copy, real images, brand colors, links, buttons, calls-to-action, and any functionality (forms, payment, booking links).
Step 8: Deploy
Push your finished site to a hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, Shopify, or wherever you're deploying).

How to Use the Chrome Extension - Full Step-by-Step
Installing the Chrome Extension
Open Google Chrome (this only works in Chrome)
Go to the Chrome Web Store - search for "Superdesign"
Click "Add to Chrome"
A popup will ask you to confirm permissions - click "Add extension"
You'll see the SuperDesign icon appear in your browser toolbar (top right area)
If you don't see it, click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar, find SuperDesign, and click the pin icon to pin it to your toolbar so it's always visible
Cloning a Full Website Page - Detailed Walkthrough
Follow these exact steps:
Step 1: Find the page you want to clone. Navigate to the website in Chrome. Make sure the full page is loaded. Scroll down through it to make sure all sections have loaded (some sites load content as you scroll).
Step 2: Click the SuperDesign extension icon. Click the SuperDesign icon in your toolbar (top right of Chrome). The extension will activate and overlay on the page. You'll see SuperDesign's interface appear.
Step 3: Select "Clone page." You'll see an option to clone the full page. Click it. SuperDesign will scan and capture the entire page - layout, colors, fonts, spacing, component structures, everything.
Step 4: Wait for the import to complete. SuperDesign will process the page and import it into your project on the web app (app.superdesign.dev). This may take a few seconds depending on how complex the page is.
Step 5: The page opens in the SuperDesign canvas. You'll now see the cloned page as an editable design in SuperDesign's canvas. It's been converted into a clean, editable Next.js workspace.
Step 6: Start modifying with the chatbox. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a chatbox. This is where you tell SuperDesign what to change. Type your instructions and let the AI redesign.
Example prompts to use after cloning:
"Keep the overall layout but change the color palette to deep burgundy, cream, and gold"
"Redesign this for a wellness coaching brand targeting professional Black women"
"Make this feel more premium - add more whitespace, upgrade the typography"
"Replace the hero section with a video background section and bold headline"
"Use this as inspiration but create a completely new landing page for a membership community at $197/month"
"Add a testimonial section with three quotes between the services and the footer"
Cloning a Single Component - Detailed Walkthrough
You don't have to grab the whole page. Sometimes you just want one specific piece - a gorgeous navigation bar, a clean pricing table, a slick testimonial layout.
Step 1: Navigate to the website in Chrome.
Step 2: Click the SuperDesign extension icon in your toolbar.
Step 3: Instead of clicking "Clone page," hover your mouse over the specific element you want to grab. As you hover, SuperDesign will highlight different sections of the page.
Step 4: Click on the specific element you want. SuperDesign will capture just that component.
Step 5: The component opens in SuperDesign as an editable piece you can modify, combine with other elements, or drop into another project.
Pro tip: You can clone individual components from MULTIPLE different websites and mix-and-match them in SuperDesign to create your own custom Frankenstein-perfect page. Grab a navigation from one site, a hero section from another, a pricing table from a third - then refine the whole thing so it feels cohesive.
What Gets Captured When You Clone
Layout structure - how elements are arranged on the page
Color palette - the hex codes and color relationships used throughout
Typography - font choices, sizes, weights, line heights
Spacing patterns - margins, padding, breathing room between elements
Component styles - buttons, cards, forms, navigation patterns, gradients, shadows
What Does NOT Transfer Perfectly
Exact images - you'll get placeholder representations, not the actual copyrighted images from the original site
Complex JavaScript animations - intricate animations may simplify during the clone
Backend functionality - forms, login systems, dynamic content, databases won't carry over
Pixel-perfect replication - it gets very close but it's a smart reconstruction, not a screenshot. Close enough for meaningful work.

How to Control Design Variations (Getting Multiple Versions)
SuperDesign gives you several ways to generate and explore multiple design options. Here's how each one works:
Method 1: Branching (Best for Controlled Exploration)
Branching is like "Save As" on steroids. You take a design you like and create separate copies to experiment with - without messing up the original.
How to do it:
You have a design on your canvas that you're working with
Use the chatbox to ask for a variation: "Create a branch with a darker, more luxurious color scheme"
SuperDesign creates a new branch - a separate version you can edit independently
Your original stays untouched
You can create as many branches as you want. Each one is independent. Try wild color changes on one branch, a different layout on another, a completely new vibe on a third - all without risk.
In the IDE extension or CLI tool, you can specify exactly how many variations:
You can give SuperDesign multiple prompts at once, and each prompt becomes its own variation. For example, three prompts like "Dark theme with neon accents," "Minimal with lots of whitespace," and "Bold gradients and shadows" would generate three distinct design branches simultaneously.
Method 2: Parallel Generation (Best for Speed)
Parallel generation lets you run multiple design conversations at the same time inside the same project.
How to do it:
In the chat panel, click the + icon at the top-right
This opens a new parallel conversation inside the same project
Give each conversation a different instruction
All conversations run independently and simultaneously
Example: You could have three parallel conversations running at once:
Conversation A → "Design a hero section with a gradient background and centered text"
Conversation B → "Design a hero section with a full-width image and left-aligned text"
Conversation C → "Design a hero section with a video background and overlay text"
All three generate at the same time. When they finish, you compare and pick your favorite.
Method 3: Prompt-Based Variations (Best for Quick Comparisons)
When chatting with SuperDesign, you can explicitly ask for multiple options in your prompt:
"Give me three different layout options for this pricing section"
"Show me this hero section in three different color palettes"
"Create variations of this page - one minimal, one bold, one elegant"
The Flow Feature (For Multi-Page Journeys)
Flow isn't about variations of the same page - it's about mapping out how users move through your site. Design your homepage, then flow into your services page, then into your booking page. This helps you see the full user journey.

OpenClaw Integration
OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant that runs locally on your own computer (or a server like a Mac Mini). It connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Slack, and it can execute real tasks - run code, control your browser, manage files, and build things.
Here's why this matters for your SuperDesign workflow: OpenClaw can take what SuperDesign creates and actually build, modify, and deploy it.
How SuperDesign + OpenClaw Work Together
Think of it this way:
SuperDesign = Your AI architect (creates the visual blueprint and code)
OpenClaw = Your AI contractor (takes the blueprint and builds the actual house)
SuperDesign generates the design and the code. OpenClaw can take that code, add your content, make modifications, and even help deploy it - all from a conversation in WhatsApp or Telegram.
Step-by-Step: SuperDesign to OpenClaw Workflow
Step 1: Design in SuperDesign Create your website design using the web app or by cloning a site with the Chrome extension. Refine it until you're happy.
Step 2: Export Two Things
Export the HTML code (this is the actual structure and styling of your design)
Export the style.md file (this is the written document of every design decision - colors, fonts, spacing, etc.)
Step 3: Save Both Files to Your Computer Save these exports somewhere OpenClaw can access - either on your desktop or in a folder that OpenClaw has permission to read. Since OpenClaw runs locally on your machine, it can read files directly from your filesystem.
Step 4: Give OpenClaw the Context Message OpenClaw (via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or its web chat - whatever channel you've set up) and tell it:
"I have a website design exported from SuperDesign. The HTML file is at [file location] and the style guide is at [file location]. I need you to:
Read both files
Replace all placeholder text with my actual copy [provide your copy or tell it where to find it]
Update the images to use [your image URLs or file paths]
Make sure the design matches the style.md specifications
Save the final version to [your desired location]"
Step 5: Let OpenClaw Build It Out OpenClaw will read your files, make the modifications, and save the results. Because OpenClaw has access to your local filesystem and can run code, it can do things like:
Edit the HTML/CSS directly
Add your real content and images
Spin up a local preview so you can see the result in your browser
Even help deploy the finished site if you connect it to your hosting platform
OpenClaw + SuperDesign: What You Can Ask OpenClaw to Do
Once you have your SuperDesign exports on your machine, here's what you can ask OpenClaw to handle:
Content replacement: "Take the SuperDesign HTML file and replace all the placeholder text. Here's my actual homepage copy: [paste your copy]. Keep all the styling exactly as it is."
Multi-page builds: "I have a style.md from SuperDesign with my full design system. Build me an About page and a Services page that match these exact design specifications. Here's the content for each page: [provide content]."
Quick modifications: "Open the SuperDesign HTML file and change the primary color from #5B2E91 to #8B1A4A. Change the font from Inter to Montserrat. Save the updated version."
Browser preview: "Open the modified HTML file in Chrome so I can preview how it looks."
Deployment assistance: "Take the final website files and push them to my Vercel/Netlify/hosting account."
OpenClaw Skills That Help With This Workflow
OpenClaw uses "skills" - plugins that extend what it can do. For website building with SuperDesign exports, these skill categories are especially useful:
File Editor skills - Let OpenClaw read, modify, and save your HTML/CSS files
Browser Use skills - Let OpenClaw open and preview your website in a browser
Terminal/System skills - Let OpenClaw run commands to deploy your site
GitHub skills - Let OpenClaw push your website code to a repository
If you don't have these skills installed yet, you can ask OpenClaw to install them. OpenClaw can even create new custom skills for specific tasks you need.
The style.md Is Your Secret Weapon With OpenClaw
Here's the move that most people miss: the style.md export from SuperDesign is the single most valuable file for working with ANY AI tool, including OpenClaw.
The style.md contains every design rule - exact colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, button styles, component patterns. When you give this to OpenClaw (or Claude, or ChatGPT, or any AI), you're essentially giving it a complete design rulebook.
This means you can design ONE page in SuperDesign, export the style.md, and then ask OpenClaw to build your OTHER pages using those same design rules - without going back to SuperDesign for every single page.
Example message to OpenClaw: "Here's my style.md file from SuperDesign [file path]. This is my brand's design system. Now build me the following pages using these exact design rules:
An About page with [this content]
A Services page with [this content]
A Contact page with a form Make sure every page matches the colors, fonts, and spacing in the style.md."

Using SuperDesign Exports With Claude (Chat Interface)
You don't need Claude Code to use SuperDesign exports with Claude. The regular Claude chat interface works perfectly. Here's how:
Method 1: Paste the Code Directly
Export your HTML code from SuperDesign
Open a Claude conversation
Paste the code and tell Claude what to do:
"Here's the HTML from my SuperDesign export. I need you to:
Replace the placeholder headline with: 'Drop the Cape. Breathe Again.'
Replace the placeholder paragraph text with: [your actual copy]
Change the call-to-action button text to 'Join the Sanctuary'
Add a section for testimonials between the hero and the footer
Keep all the existing styling exactly as it is"
Method 2: Upload the Files
Export your files from SuperDesign (HTML + style.md)
Upload both files to a Claude conversation
Ask Claude to work with them:
"I've uploaded my SuperDesign exports. The HTML file is my homepage design, and the style.md is my design system. Can you add my actual content to the homepage and then create a matching Services page using the same design rules?"
Method 3: Use the style.md as a Design Brief
Even without the code, the style.md alone is powerful:
"Here's my design system from SuperDesign [paste style.md content]. Build me a clean HTML landing page for a wellness membership community using these exact design specifications. The page needs a hero section, three benefit cards, a pricing section at $197/month, and testimonials."

Smart Ways to Use SuperDesign (Practical Scenarios)
Scenario 1: "I Found a Site I Love and Want Something Similar"
Browse the site in Chrome
Clone it with the extension
In SuperDesign, prompt: "Redesign this for a wellness brand targeting professional Black women. Use colors [your colors]. Make it feel warm but premium."
Branch it to explore 2-3 different directions
Export HTML + style.md and hand to your AI tool of choice
Scenario 2: "I Need a Landing Page for My Membership FAST"
Open SuperDesign web app
Prompt: "Design a membership landing page with a hero headline, three membership benefits with icons, a pricing section, testimonials from three women, and a strong call-to-action button"
Use parallel generation to get 3 versions at once
Pick your favorite, refine it
Export and hand to OpenClaw or Claude to add your real content
Scenario 3: "I Want to Redesign My Current Website"
Go to your current live website in Chrome
Clone it with the SuperDesign extension
In SuperDesign, prompt: "Modernize this design. Make it feel more premium. Add more whitespace. Update the color scheme to [new colors]."
Branch to compare old vs. new
Export the new version and hand off for implementation
Scenario 4: "I Need Individual Components, Not a Full Page"
Browse sites you admire
Clone individual components (a specific nav bar, a testimonial section, a pricing table)
Collect them in SuperDesign
Mix and match, then use the chat to unify the style
Export the combined result
Scenario 5: "I Want to Build Multiple Pages That All Match"
Design your homepage in SuperDesign
Export the style.md (your design rulebook)
Give the style.md to OpenClaw or Claude
Ask the AI to build your other pages (About, Services, Contact, etc.) following the same design rules
This way, every page matches without designing each one individually in SuperDesign

The SuperDesign Canvas - Key Features You Should Know
Branching
Take any design and create a branch - a separate version you can experiment with without messing up the original. Try wild color changes, different layouts, completely new vibes - all without risk. Create as many branches as you want.
Parallel Generation
Run multiple design conversations simultaneously inside the same project. Click the + icon in the chat panel to open a new parallel conversation. Each one runs independently and generates at the same time.
Flow
Map out multi-page user journeys. Design your homepage, then flow into your services page, then into your booking page. See how users will move through your site.
Version History
Every change is saved. Scroll back through your version history and restore any previous state. Made a change you hate? Roll it back instantly.
Export Options
Code export (React) - Production-ready React components for developer environments
Code export (HTML) - Universal HTML/CSS that works with any tool or platform
style.md - The design system document with every design decision documented. Works with ANY AI tool.
Shopify Theme - A Shopify-compatible theme generated directly from your design

Tips for Getting the Best Results
Be specific in your prompts. "Design a landing page" will give you something generic. "Design a premium wellness coaching landing page for professional women, with a warm color palette of deep plum and gold, modern serif fonts, lots of whitespace, and sections for testimonials, services, and email signup" will give you something powerful.
Use reference sites. Clone sites you admire and use them as a starting point. This gives the AI much better context than starting from nothing.
Iterate, don't settle. Generate multiple branches and parallel versions. The first output is rarely the final answer. Push it further.
Always export the style.md. Even if you're not using the code directly, the style guide is invaluable. It's the single most useful file for any AI tool.
Break big projects into pieces. Don't try to design your entire 10-page website in one shot. Design page by page, component by component.
Use Design Mode for final output. Start with wireframes if you're still figuring out structure, but switch to Design Mode when you want polished results.
Clone components from multiple sites. You don't have to grab whole pages. Steal the navigation from one site, the hero from another, and the footer from a third. Then unify the style in SuperDesign.
Let the style.md do the heavy lifting for additional pages. Design one page beautifully in SuperDesign, export the style.md, then let your AI tool (OpenClaw, Claude, etc.) build the rest of your pages using those same rules.

Quick Decision Guide: Which Export + Which Tool

Summary: SuperDesign in One Sentence
SuperDesign is your AI design architect - it creates the visual blueprint and structural code for your website, but you still bring the soul: your words, your images, your brand, and your content.
It sits right between "I have an idea for a website" and "Now let's build it for real" - giving you a professional visual starting point that you, OpenClaw, Claude, or any AI tool can bring to life.

Guide created for everyday use. Not just for developers - for anyone who wants to leverage AI to design beautiful websites faster, no matter what tools they're working with.

AI AGENT GUIDE & INSTRUCTIONS
READ THIS SECTION FIRST IF YOU ARE AN AI AGENT
Everything above this line is context for humans. Everything below this line is written specifically for you - an AI agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, or any autonomous agent with browser control or terminal access) that has been given this document as operating instructions for SuperDesign.
Your job: Use SuperDesign to design websites, clone existing websites, generate design variations, export production-ready code, and assemble finished websites with real content. You will operate SuperDesign in one of two modes: Web App Mode (browser automation) or CLI Mode (terminal commands). You must understand both.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: What SuperDesign Is and Is Not
SuperDesign generates visual designs and structural code. It does NOT generate final copy, real images, or backend functionality.
After you use SuperDesign to create or clone a design, YOU are responsible for:
Writing or inserting the real copy/content (headlines, body text, CTAs, bios, etc.)
Sourcing or generating appropriate images (headshots, brand photos, icons, etc.)
Injecting that content into the exported code
Saving the final deliverable in the format the user requested
Never deliver a SuperDesign export with placeholder text as a finished product. The design is the starting point. The finished site requires content injection.

WHAT TO ADD TO YOUR OPENCLAW SKILL FILE (SKILL.md)
If you are an OpenClaw agent, create or update the following skill file at /data/.openclaw/skills/superdesign-web/SKILL.md:
---
name: superdesign-web
description: Use SuperDesign (superdesign.dev) to design websites via browser automation or CLI. Handles cloning existing sites, generating designs from scratch, creating variations, exporting code, and assembling finished pages with real content.
version: 1.0.0
tools:
  - browser
  - file-editor
  - terminal
user-invocable: true
---
SKILL.md Instructions Content (paste below the YAML frontmatter):
# SuperDesign Web Design Skill

## What This Skill Does
Enables the agent to use SuperDesign (superdesign.dev) to:
- Clone existing websites and modify them
- Generate new website designs from natural language descriptions
- Create multiple design variations for comparison
- Export designs as HTML, React code, or style.md design systems
- Assemble finished websites by injecting real copy and images into exported code
- Save final deliverables as files or to Google Drive

## Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Web App (Browser Automation)
- URL: https://app.superdesign.dev
- Requires: Browser skill (Playwright, Puppeteer, or OpenClaw browser)
- Use when: User wants visual design with canvas interaction, cloning via Chrome extension, or doesn't have CLI set up

### Mode 2: CLI (Terminal Commands)
- Requires: superdesign npm package installed globally
- Install: npm install -g openclaw@latest (includes superdesign skill integration)
- Use when: User wants faster execution, parallel batch generation, or headless operation

## Workflow Decision Tree
1. Is there a URL to clone? → CLONE WORKFLOW
2. Is there a brand/design brief but no URL? → CREATE FROM SCRATCH WORKFLOW
3. Is there an existing SuperDesign project to modify? → ITERATE WORKFLOW

## Key URLs
- Web App: https://app.superdesign.dev
- Docs: https://docs.superdesign.dev
- Chrome Extension: Install from Chrome Web Store (search "Superdesign")

## File Naming Convention
All SuperDesign outputs should be saved with this pattern:
- Design exports: superdesign_[project-name]_[date]_[version].html
- Style guides: superdesign_[project-name]_style.md
- Final assembled sites: [project-name]_final_[date].html
- Copy documents: [project-name]_copy_[date].txt

## Post-Design Checklist (ALWAYS run after design export)
1. Generate real copy for all placeholder text sections
2. Source or generate images for all placeholder image slots
3. Inject copy and images into exported code
4. Verify responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
5. Save final deliverable in user's requested format
6. Report completion with summary of what was built

WHAT TO ADD TO YOUR OPENCLAW MEMORY FILE
Add the following to your OpenClaw memory or context file so it persists across sessions:
## SuperDesign Knowledge

SuperDesign is an AI-powered website design tool at superdesign.dev. I use it to create website designs and export production-ready code.

Key facts I must remember:
- SuperDesign generates DESIGNS and CODE, not finished websites. I must always add real copy and images after export.
- The web app is at app.superdesign.dev. The canvas is where designs appear. The chatbox at the bottom is where I type instructions.
- The Chrome extension clones live websites into editable SuperDesign projects.
- Exports come in three forms: React code, HTML/CSS, and style.md (design system document).
- The style.md is the most universally useful export. It contains every design decision and can be used to build additional pages that match.
- I can generate multiple design variations using branching (in canvas) or by providing multiple prompts (in CLI).
- Cloning a site captures layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and component styles. It does NOT capture images, backend functionality, or complex animations.
- SuperDesign uses Design Mode (polished, high-fidelity) and Wireframe Mode (rough structural layouts). Default to Design Mode for final output.
- Wait states matter: after submitting a prompt or cloning a page, I must wait for generation to complete before interacting with the result. Look for the canvas to update or the loading indicator to stop.
- For parallel generation in the web app, click the + icon in the chat panel to open additional concurrent conversations.

MODE 1: WEB APP BROWSER AUTOMATION INSTRUCTIONS
These instructions are for when you are controlling a browser (via Playwright, Puppeteer, OpenClaw browser skill, or any browser automation tool) to operate SuperDesign's web app.
Authentication & Setup
Navigate to https://app.superdesign.dev
If a login screen appears, authenticate with the user's credentials (Google OAuth or email). If no credentials are available, ask the user.
Once logged in, you will see the canvas (main workspace area) and the chat panel (usually on the right side or bottom).
Confirm you are on the correct workspace. If the user has multiple projects, select or create the appropriate one.
WORKFLOW A: CLONING A WEBSITE (Web App / Browser Automation)
Prerequisites: The SuperDesign Chrome extension must be installed in the browser you are controlling. If it is not installed, navigate to https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/superdesign/obpjaonipoaomjnokbimppohbpjibflm and install it first.
Step-by-step process:
Step 1: Navigate to the target website.
Open a new tab in the browser
Navigate to the URL the user wants to clone
Wait for the page to fully load. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to trigger any lazy-loaded content, then scroll back to the top.
WAIT: Confirm the page has fully rendered. Look for all images, text, and layout elements to be visible.
Step 2: Activate the SuperDesign Chrome extension.
Click the SuperDesign extension icon in the Chrome toolbar (typically in the top-right extensions area)
If the icon is not visible, click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions menu) and find SuperDesign in the dropdown
WAIT: The extension overlay should appear on the page
Step 3: Choose clone type.
To clone the FULL PAGE: Click the "Clone page" button in the extension overlay
To clone a SINGLE COMPONENT: Hover over the specific element you want (navigation bar, hero section, pricing table, footer, etc.). The extension will highlight elements as you hover. Click the specific element you want to capture.
Step 4: Wait for import to complete.
After clicking clone, SuperDesign will process and import the page
WAIT: This can take 5-30 seconds depending on page complexity
You will be redirected to app.superdesign.dev with the cloned design in the canvas
VERIFY: Confirm the design appeared on the canvas. If the canvas is empty, the clone may have failed - retry Step 2-3.
Step 5: Modify the cloned design.
Locate the chatbox (bottom of the screen in the SuperDesign web app)
Click the chatbox to focus it
Type your modification instructions
Press Enter or click the Send button
WAIT: Generation takes 10-60 seconds. Watch for the canvas to update. Do NOT type another instruction until the current one finishes.
Step 6: Generate variations (if requested).
To create branches: In the chatbox, type a variation prompt (e.g., "Create a variation with a dark color scheme and gold accents")
Each branch prompt creates a separate version on the canvas
To run parallel generations: Click the + icon at the top-right of the chat panel. This opens a new concurrent conversation. Type a different instruction in each conversation.
For 3 variations: Open 2 additional parallel conversations (3 total). Give each a different design direction.
Step 7: Select the best version.
Review all generated variations on the canvas
Click on each frame to preview it
If the user is available, present the variations and ask which they prefer
If operating autonomously, select the version that best matches the brand specifications provided
Step 8: Export the design.
Click on the frame you want to export
Look for the Export button or View Code option
For HTML export: Select code export, choose HTML format, copy or download the code
For style.md export: Look for the style guide or design system export option, copy or download
SAVE BOTH: Save the HTML code AND the style.md to the local filesystem
Step 9: Proceed to Post-Design Assembly (see section below).

WORKFLOW B: CREATING A DESIGN FROM SCRATCH (Web App / Browser Automation)
Step 1: Open SuperDesign.
Navigate to https://app.superdesign.dev
Authenticate if needed
Create a new project or select an existing workspace
Step 2: Set the design mode.
Look for a mode toggle or dropdown in the chat interface
For polished, production-ready output: Select Design Mode
For rough structural layouts (early exploration): Select Wireframe Mode
DEFAULT: Use Design Mode unless explicitly told otherwise
Step 3: Prepare your prompt. Before typing anything, construct a detailed prompt. A good prompt includes:
Page type: landing page, about page, services page, pricing page, etc.
Color specifications: exact hex codes if available, or descriptive colors ("deep plum and gold")
Font preferences: specific fonts or general style ("modern serif," "clean sans-serif")
Sections needed: hero section, testimonials, pricing table, FAQ, email signup, footer, etc.
Design feel: premium, warm, minimal, bold, luxurious, playful, etc.
Target audience context: if relevant (e.g., "for professional women in corporate wellness")
Example well-structured prompt: "Design a premium landing page for a wellness membership community. Color palette: deep plum (#5B2E91), cream (#FFF8F0), and gold (#C9A84C). Modern serif fonts for headlines, clean sans-serif for body text. Sections: 1) Hero with bold headline and CTA button, 2) Three benefit cards with icons, 3) Testimonial carousel with three quotes, 4) Pricing section showing $197/month membership, 5) FAQ accordion with 5 questions, 6) Footer with social links and email signup. Design feel: warm, premium, luxurious with lots of whitespace."
Step 4: Submit the prompt.
Click the chatbox at the bottom of the SuperDesign interface
Type (or paste) your prepared prompt
Press Enter or click Send
WAIT: Generation takes 15-90 seconds depending on complexity. Watch for the canvas to update. A loading indicator may appear. Do NOT submit another prompt until generation completes.
Step 5: Verify the initial result.
Once the canvas updates, click on the generated frame to preview it
Check that all requested sections are present
Check that the color scheme matches specifications
Check that the overall feel matches the requested style
If major elements are missing or wrong, submit a follow-up prompt to correct: "The testimonial section is missing. Add a testimonial carousel between the pricing section and the footer."
Step 6: Generate variations.
Method 1 - Branching: Type a variation prompt in the chatbox: "Create a branch of this design with a darker background and bolder typography"
Method 2 - Parallel generation: Click the + icon in the chat panel to open parallel conversations. Give each conversation a different design direction.
How many variations to generate: Default to 3 unless the user specifies a number. More than 5 variations becomes difficult to evaluate effectively.
Step 7: Refine the selected design. After choosing the best variation, use the chatbox for refinements:
"Add more breathing room between sections"
"Make the CTA button larger and more prominent"
"Change the testimonial section background to a subtle gradient"
"Ensure mobile responsiveness - the hero section should stack vertically on mobile"
Submit ONE refinement at a time. WAIT for each to complete before submitting the next.
Step 8: Export.
Follow the export steps from Workflow A, Step 8
Always export BOTH the code (HTML preferred for maximum compatibility) AND the style.md
Step 9: Proceed to Post-Design Assembly (see section below).

POST-DESIGN ASSEMBLY PROCESS
This is the most critical section. After SuperDesign generates the design and you have exported the code, you MUST complete these steps before delivering to the user.
Step 1: Generate the Real Copy
SuperDesign outputs placeholder text. You must replace it with real content. If the user has not provided copy, generate it based on:
The user's brand voice and tone (check memory, skill files, or ask)
The page's purpose (landing page, about page, services page, etc.)
The target audience
The sections present in the design (hero headline, subheadline, body text, CTA text, testimonials, FAQ questions/answers, footer text, etc.)
For each section of the exported HTML, identify placeholder text and generate replacement copy:
Step 2: Source or Generate Images
Identify every placeholder image in the exported code. For each one, determine what type of image belongs there:
Hero background images - Generate using an image generation tool, or ask the user for their brand imagery
Headshots/photos - Ask the user for actual photos. Do not generate fake headshots.
Icons - Use icon libraries (Heroicons, Lucide) or generate simple SVG icons
Decorative images - Generate using AI image tools if available, or use stock photo URLs the user approves
Logo - Ask the user for their logo file
If you have access to image generation tools (fal.ai skill, DALL-E, etc.), generate appropriate images. If not, insert descriptive placeholder comments in the code: <!-- INSERT: Hero background image showing [description] --> so the user knows exactly what to add.
Step 3: Inject Content Into the Code
Open the exported HTML file and systematically replace:
All placeholder headlines with your generated copy
All placeholder body text with your generated copy
All placeholder button text with your generated CTA text
All placeholder image src attributes with real image URLs or file paths
All placeholder names/titles with real names (or clearly marked placeholders)
Update any hardcoded colors if they don't match the brand specifications
Update any meta tags (page title, description) with real content
Step 4: Verify the Result
Before saving the final deliverable:
Desktop check: Open/render the HTML and verify it looks correct at desktop width (1200px+)
Tablet check: Verify at tablet width (~768px) - sections should reorganize cleanly
Mobile check: Verify at mobile width (~375px) - everything should stack vertically, text should be readable, buttons should be tappable
Content check: Read through all visible text. Confirm no placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum" or "Your headline here" remains.
Image check: Confirm all images either load correctly or have clear placeholder comments
Link check: Ensure CTA buttons have appropriate href attributes (even if just "#" as placeholders)
Color check: Visually confirm the color scheme matches the brand specifications
Step 5: Save the Final Deliverable
Save the finished product in the format the user needs:
Option A - Google Document (if Google Drive is connected):
Create a new Google Doc
Title it: "[Project Name] - Website Code - [Date]"
Paste the complete HTML code into the document
Add a header note: "This is the complete HTML/CSS code for your [page type]. Copy this entire code into your hosting platform or give it to your developer."
Also create a separate Google Doc for the style.md if applicable
Option B - Local File (saved to desktop or specified folder):
Save the final HTML as: [project-name]_final_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
Save the style.md as: [project-name]_style_[YYYY-MM-DD].md
Save a copy of the generated text as: [project-name]_copy_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt
Default save location: User's Desktop unless otherwise specified
Notify the user of the exact file path(s)
Option C - Both (recommended):
Save locally AND to Google Drive for redundancy
Step 6: Report Completion
After saving, provide the user with a summary:
What was designed (page type, sections included)
How many variations were generated and which was selected
What content was generated vs. what still needs user input (e.g., "I used placeholder testimonials - please replace with real customer quotes")
Where the files are saved
What the next step is (deploy to hosting, hand to developer, review and approve, etc.)

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AI AGENTS
Patience with generation: SuperDesign's AI generation takes time. In browser automation, you MUST implement appropriate wait states. Do not click, type, or submit anything while a generation is in progress. Look for loading indicators to clear or the canvas to update before proceeding.
One instruction at a time in the web app: Submit one prompt, wait for completion, verify the result, then submit the next prompt. Rapid-fire prompting causes errors and incomplete generations.
The style.md is reusable: Once you have a style.md from one page design, you can use it to build additional pages that match - without going back to SuperDesign. This is the most efficient way to build a multi-page site.
Never deliver placeholder content: Your job is not done when you have the SuperDesign export. It's done when you have a finished page with real content, real images (or clearly marked image placeholders with descriptions), and verified responsive layout.
Brand voice matters: When generating copy, match the user's brand voice. If you have brand voice documentation, tone guidelines, or example copy in your memory or context, USE IT. Generic corporate copy is not acceptable if brand context is available.
Ask before assuming on images: If you don't have access to real images and can't generate appropriate ones, insert clear HTML comments describing exactly what image should go there rather than leaving broken image tags. Example: <!-- INSERT IMAGE: Professional headshot of founder, warm lighting, approachable expression -->
File management: Always tell the user exactly where you saved files. Provide full file paths. If saving to Google Drive, provide the document URL. Never save files without reporting their location.
Responsive is non-negotiable: Every exported site must work on desktop, tablet, and mobile. If the SuperDesign export has responsive issues, fix them in the code before delivering. Common fixes: ensure images have max-width: 100%, ensure flex/grid containers wrap on smaller screens, ensure text is readable at mobile sizes.
Version your work: If you generate multiple versions, save each one with a clear version number in the filename. Don't overwrite previous versions.
When in doubt, ask the user. If you're unsure about design direction, copy tone, image choices, or any subjective decision - present options and ask rather than guessing wrong.

SUPERDESIGN COMMAND CHEAT SHEET

superdesign search-prompts --keyword "wellness landing page" --json

# Search by style tags
superdesign search-prompts --tags "style" --json

# Search by BOTH keyword and style
superdesign search-prompts --tags "style" --keyword "premium minimal" --json

# Get specific prompt templates by their slugs
# (slugs are the IDs returned from search-prompts results)
superdesign get-prompts --slugs "modern-saas,luxury-brand" --json

# Extract a full brand guide from any live website
# Returns: colors, typography, spacing tokens, layout patterns
superdesign extract-brand-guide --url https://example.com --json
Pro tip: Always run extract-brand-guide on the site you're cloning. Save the output to .superdesign/design-system.md - this becomes the rulebook for your entire project.
🎨 PROJECT CREATION COMMANDS
These commands create new SuperDesign projects - either from scratch or from an existing HTML file.
# Create a project with an inline design prompt
superdesign create-project \
  --title "My Landing Page" \
  --set-project-prompt "Design a premium landing page with dark theme, gold accents, serif headlines" \
  --json

# Create a project using a design system file (recommended)
superdesign create-project \
  --title "My Landing Page" \
  --set-project-prompt-file .superdesign/design-system.md \
  --json

# Create a project from an existing HTML file + design system
# (Best for cloning - use the HTML as a starting point)
superdesign create-project \
  --title "Cloned Site Redesign" \
  --html-file ./my-template.html \
  --set-project-prompt-file .superdesign/design-system.md \
  --json

# Create a brand new design from scratch within an existing project
# (Use sparingly - only for adding completely new pages)
superdesign create-design-draft \
  --project-id <project-id> \
  --title "About Page" \
  -p "Design an about page with founder bio, mission statement, and team section" \
  --json
Every create command returns a draftId - save this! You need it for all iteration commands.
🔄 ITERATION & VARIATION COMMANDS
These are the commands you'll use most. They let you refine, branch, and explore multiple directions from any design.
# REPLACE MODE - Single update, modifies the design in place
# Use for: refinements, fixes, adjustments to the current design
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <draft-id> \
  -p "Add more whitespace between sections and make the CTA button larger" \
  --mode replace \
  --json

# BRANCH MODE - Creates separate variations (one per prompt)
# Use for: exploring different design directions
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <draft-id> \
  -p "Dark theme with neon accents" \
  -p "Soft pastels with rounded corners" \
  -p "Bold minimalist with large typography" \
  --mode branch \
  --json

# BRANCH MODE with count - Generate multiple versions of a single direction
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <draft-id> \
  -p "Modern premium wellness design" \
  --mode branch \
  --count 3 \
  --json
Key difference:
--mode replace = "Fix this one design" (updates in place)
--mode branch = "Show me different options" (creates new variations)
Multiple -p flags in branch mode = each prompt becomes its own variation
Prompt tips for branching: Keep branch prompts directional and brief. Don't specify exact colors or fonts - let SuperDesign's design intelligence fill in the details based on your design system. Example: -p "Warmer, more feminine feel"not -p "Change background to #FFE4E1, use Playfair Display font, add pink accents everywhere"
📋 MANAGEMENT & VIEWING COMMANDS
# List all designs in your workspace
superdesign list --json

# Fetch all design nodes in a specific project
superdesign fetch-design-nodes --project-id <project-id> --json

# Get a specific design by its draft ID
superdesign get-design --draft-id <draft-id> --json

# Open an interactive HTML gallery of ALL your designs
# (Opens in your default browser - great for reviewing and comparing)

LEVEL 3: IDE EXTENSION COMMANDS (Inside Your Code Editor)
Install: Open VS Code/Cursor/Windsurf → Extensions → Search "SuperDesign" → Install
These commands are run from inside your code editor using the Command Palette.
Command Palette Shortcuts
What Happens When You Initialize
Running initializeProject creates these files automatically:
.cursor/rules/design.mdc - Design rules for Cursor
CLAUDE.md - Design rules for Claude Code
.windsurfrules - Design rules for Windsurf
default_ui_darkmode.css - Default stylesheet
Cursor Pro Tip: Copy the prompt from design.mdc and create a custom mode in Cursor with that same system prompt. This gives significantly better design performance.
IDE Workflow
Initialize the project (superdesign: initializeProject)
Open the canvas (superdesign: open canva)
Type your prompt in the sidebar chat panel
View results in the canvas panel (auto-updates as files generate)
Fork/iterate by selecting a design and describing changes
Copy the prompt from SuperDesign and paste it into your coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code) to implement
Multi-select pages to generate comprehensive implementation prompts
MCP Server Integration (Advanced - for Claude Code)
If you use Claude Code, you can install the SuperDesign MCP server for even deeper integration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superdesign": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/superdesign/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
This gives Claude Code native access to these tools:
superdesign_generate - Generate new designs from prompts
superdesign_iterate - Refine existing designs
superdesign_extract_system - Extract design systems from screenshots
superdesign_list - List all designs in workspace
superdesign_gallery - Open interactive gallery
No API keys needed - uses Claude Code's built-in LLM connection.

🎯 INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC INSPIRATION
If you serve a specific niche, these targeted searches work well:

📝 HOW TO USE INSPIRATION WITH SUPERDESIGN (Step-by-Step)
Browse any of the sites above until something catches your eye
Click through to the actual live website (not just the gallery thumbnail)
Take note of what specifically you like: the color scheme? The layout? The typography? The overall vibe? A specific section?
Choose your path:
Full clone: Use SuperDesign's Chrome extension to clone the entire page, then modify it to match your brand
Component clone: Use the extension to grab just the sections you like from multiple different sites
Style extraction: Use the CLI command superdesign extract-brand-guide --url [URL] to capture the design DNA (colors, fonts, spacing) and apply it to a new design
Visual reference: Screenshot it, describe what you like to SuperDesign's chat in your own words, and let it generate something inspired by (not identical to) the reference
Always customize: Never use a cloned site as-is. Change the colors to your brand, replace all content with your copy, swap images, and make it unmistakably yours.

DESIGN BEST PRACTICES FOR AI AGENTS
Instructions That Guide How AI Agents Use SuperDesign
Add this section to your agent's memory, context file, or SKILL.md to ensure every design it produces is not just generated - but genuinely well-designed.

WHY THIS MATTERS
SuperDesign generates the structure. But structure without good design principles produces mediocre results. These instructions ensure the AI agent understands fundamental design rules so it can:
Write better prompts that produce better initial designs
Evaluate generated designs against real quality standards
Make smarter refinement decisions
Catch common design mistakes before delivering to the user
Produce work that looks like it came from a professional, not a robot

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (For Agent Memory/Context)
Add this block to your agent's memory or context file:
## Design Best Practices I Must Follow

### 1. VISUAL HIERARCHY - Guide the Eye
Every page must have a clear visual hierarchy that tells the viewer what to look at first, second, and third.
- The most important element (usually the headline) should be the largest and most prominent
- Use size, color, weight, and spacing to create levels of importance
- CTAs (call-to-action buttons) should be the most visually distinct element on the page
- If everything is bold, nothing is bold. Restraint creates emphasis.

WHEN PROMPTING: Always specify which element is most important. Example: "The headline should be the dominant visual element, with the CTA button as the second most prominent."

WHEN EVALUATING: If I look at a generated design and can't immediately tell what I should read/click first, the hierarchy is broken. Request refinement.

### 2. WHITESPACE IS NOT EMPTY SPACE - It's Breathing Room
Whitespace (also called negative space) is one of the most powerful design tools. It creates:
- Readability - text surrounded by space is easier to read
- Focus - elements with generous spacing feel more important and premium
- Elegance - luxury brands use MORE whitespace, not less
- Scannability - users can quickly find what they need

WHEN PROMPTING: Always include "generous whitespace" or "breathing room between sections" in design prompts. Never ask to "fill all the space."

WHEN EVALUATING: If a design feels cramped, cluttered, or overwhelming, request: "Add significantly more whitespace between all sections. Increase padding inside cards and containers. Let the design breathe."

### 3. TYPOGRAPHY - Two Fonts Maximum
Good typography follows strict rules:
- Use a MAXIMUM of two font families per design (one for headlines, one for body text)
- Headlines: Can be bold, decorative, serif, or display fonts
- Body text: Must be clean, readable, and simple (sans-serif works best for web)
- Minimum body text size: 16px for web (never smaller)
- Line height for body text: 1.5x to 1.75x the font size
- Maximum line length: 65-75 characters per line for readability
- Create contrast between headline and body fonts (pair a serif with a sans-serif, or a bold with a light)

WHEN PROMPTING: Specify font style, not just font name. Example: "Modern serif headlines paired with clean sans-serif body text" rather than just "nice fonts."

WHEN EVALUATING: If text is hard to read, lines are too long, or there are more than 2 font families, request corrections.

### 4. COLOR - Less Is More
Effective color usage follows this formula:
- PRIMARY color: 60% of the design (usually the background or dominant tone)
- SECONDARY color: 30% (supporting elements, secondary backgrounds)
- ACCENT color: 10% (CTAs, highlights, interactive elements)
- Never use more than 3-4 colors total (plus black/white/gray)
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1 ratio for normal text)
- Dark text on light background is easier to read than light text on dark background for body copy

WHEN PROMPTING: Always provide exact hex codes when available. If not available, describe the color mood: "warm earth tones," "cool blues and silvers," "deep jewel tones."

WHEN EVALUATING: If colors clash, if there are too many competing colors, or if text is hard to read against its background, request corrections.

### 5. CONSISTENCY - Same Rules Everywhere
Every element of the same type should look and behave the same way throughout the entire design:
- All buttons should have the same border radius, padding, and font style
- All section headings should use the same font, size, and color
- Spacing between sections should be uniform
- Card designs should use consistent padding, shadows, and corner radius
- Icons should be from the same set and the same style (don't mix outlined and filled icons)

WHEN PROMPTING: Reference the style.md if available. Say: "Maintain consistent button styles, heading styles, and spacing throughout all sections."

WHEN EVALUATING: If buttons look different in different sections, or spacing is inconsistent, request: "Make all [element] consistent throughout the page."

### 6. MOBILE-FIRST THINKING - Stack and Simplify
Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Every design must work on a phone screen:
- Sections should stack vertically on mobile (no side-by-side layouts below 768px)
- Touch targets (buttons, links) should be at least 44px × 44px
- Text should remain readable without zooming (minimum 16px)
- Images should scale to full width on mobile
- Navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile
- Horizontal scrolling should never be required

WHEN PROMPTING: Always include "fully responsive, mobile-first" in the design prompt.

WHEN EVALUATING: After export, verify the design at 375px width (iPhone). If anything is broken, cut off, or unreadable - fix it in the code before delivering.

### 7. ALIGNMENT - Everything Lines Up
Professional design has invisible grid lines that everything snaps to:
- All text should be left-aligned (for English/left-to-right languages) OR consistently centered. Never mix randomly.
- Elements in the same row should align to the same baseline
- Card groups should have equal widths and heights
- Section padding should be consistent (if one section has 80px top/bottom padding, they all should)
- Images in a grid should be the same dimensions

WHEN PROMPTING: Say "Clean grid alignment" or "Everything aligned to a consistent grid."

WHEN EVALUATING: If elements look "off" or misaligned, request specific alignment corrections.

### 8. CONTRAST AND READABILITY - Can They Actually Read It?
The #1 design sin is pretty but unreadable:
- Dark text on light backgrounds for body copy (ALWAYS)
- Light text on dark backgrounds only for short headlines or overlay text with sufficient contrast
- Never place text directly on a busy image without a dark/light overlay
- Ensure buttons have enough contrast to be immediately identifiable as clickable
- Links should be visually distinct from regular text (underline, different color, or both)

WHEN EVALUATING: Squint at the design. If you can't read everything easily while squinting, contrast is too low. Request: "Increase text contrast. Ensure all body text has a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background."

### 9. SECTION FLOW - Tell a Story
A landing page is a sales conversation. Sections should flow in a logical order:

Recommended section order for landing pages:
1. HERO - Bold headline + subheadline + CTA (What is this? Why should I care?)
2. SOCIAL PROOF - Logos, stats, or a brief credibility statement (Why should I trust you?)
3. BENEFITS/FEATURES - What do I get? (3-4 benefit cards work well)
4. HOW IT WORKS - Simple 3-step process (How does this work?)
5. TESTIMONIALS - Real words from real people (Has this worked for others?)
6. PRICING - Clear, simple pricing (What does it cost?)
7. FAQ - Address objections (What if I have concerns?)
8. FINAL CTA - Repeat the call to action (I'm ready - what do I do?)
9. FOOTER - Contact, social links, legal

WHEN PROMPTING: Specify the section order. Don't just list sections - put them in the order that tells the best story.

WHEN EVALUATING: If the flow feels random or jumpy, suggest reordering sections to follow the "story" structure above.

### 10. IMAGERY AND ICONS - Support the Message
Visuals should reinforce the content, not distract from it:
- Use consistent image styles (all photos should have similar lighting, color treatment, and cropping)
- Icons should be from the SAME icon set (never mix icon styles)
- Decorative elements should be subtle, not competing with content
- Hero images should evoke the emotional outcome, not just show the product
- Avoid generic stock photo feel (people pointing at screens, shaking hands, etc.)

WHEN PROMPTING: Describe the image mood, not just the subject. Example: "Hero image should evoke calm, ease, and luxury - think soft morning light, peaceful spaces" not just "put an image in the hero."

WHEN EVALUATING: If images feel generic, inconsistent, or distracting, flag them for replacement.

DESIGN QUALITY CHECKLIST (For Agent Use Before Every Delivery)
Add this to your agent's operational checklist - run through it before delivering any design to a user:
## Pre-Delivery Design Quality Check

□ HIERARCHY: Can I immediately identify the most important element on the page?
□ WHITESPACE: Does the design have generous breathing room? Does it feel spacious, not cramped?
□ TYPOGRAPHY: Are there only 1-2 font families? Is body text at least 16px? Is everything readable?
□ COLOR: Are there 3-4 colors maximum (plus neutrals)? Does the palette feel cohesive?
□ CONSISTENCY: Do all buttons look the same? All headings? All cards? All spacing?
□ MOBILE: Does the design work at 375px width? Do sections stack? Is text readable?
□ ALIGNMENT: Is everything on a clean grid? No random misalignments?
□ CONTRAST: Can I read every piece of text easily? Are CTAs visually distinct?
□ FLOW: Do sections tell a logical story? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end?
□ IMAGERY: Are all images consistent in style? Do they support the message?
□ CTA: Is there at least one clear call-to-action? Is it impossible to miss?
□ BRAND: Does the design match the user's brand colors, fonts, and tone?

COMMON DESIGN MISTAKES TO CATCH AND FIX
These are the most frequent problems AI-generated designs produce. Train your agent to watch for them:

PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR BETTER DESIGNS
The quality of what SuperDesign generates depends heavily on the quality of the prompt. Train your agent to write prompts using this structure:
## Prompt Template for SuperDesign

[PAGE TYPE] + [COLOR SPECS] + [FONT DIRECTION] + [SECTIONS IN ORDER] + [DESIGN FEEL] + [AUDIENCE CONTEXT] + [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]

Example:
"Design a premium landing page for a wellness membership community.

Colors: deep plum (#5B2E91) as primary, cream (#FFF8F0) as background, gold (#C9A84C) as accent.

Typography: Modern serif for headlines (think editorial, elegant), clean sans-serif for body text (think approachable, readable).

Sections in this order:
1. Hero - bold headline centered, subheadline, single CTA button
2. Three benefit cards with icons in a row
3. Full-width testimonial with large quote marks
4. Pricing section - one plan, $197/month, with feature list
5. FAQ accordion - 5 questions
6. Final CTA section - headline + button
7. Minimal footer with social links

Design feel: Warm, premium, luxurious. Generous whitespace. Think high-end spa, not corporate office. Soft, not harsh. Elegant, not flashy.

Audience: Professional women 38+, corporate leaders, dealing with burnout. The design should feel like a deep breath - calming and aspirational.

Requirements: Fully responsive. Mobile-first. All CTA buttons should be gold (#C9A84C) with dark text. Cards should have subtle shadows, not hard borders."
Why this works: SuperDesign's AI generates dramatically better results when it has specific color codes, clear section order, emotional descriptors, and audience context. Vague prompts produce vague designs.

WELLNESS / COACHING / PERSONAL BRAND DESIGN GUIDELINES
For agents working on wellness, coaching, personal development, or lifestyle brands specifically, these additional rules apply:
## Wellness & Coaching Design Rules

WARMTH OVER CORPORATE:
- Use warm color palettes (creams, golds, soft pinks, earth tones, deep jewel tones)
- Avoid cold corporate blues, grays, and whites-only palettes
- Round corners on elements (8-16px border radius) - sharp corners feel clinical
- Use serif or elegant sans-serif fonts - not stark geometric fonts

EMOTIONAL DESIGN:
- Hero sections should evoke a FEELING, not just state a fact
- Use aspirational imagery (calm spaces, natural light, peaceful moments)
- Testimonials should feel personal and emotional, not corporate
- The overall design should feel like an exhale - not a sales pitch

TRUST SIGNALS:
- Include social proof early (after the hero section)
- Show real human faces where possible (founder photos, client photos)
- Include specific numbers where available (years of experience, number of clients served)
- Certifications, media logos, or "as seen in" badges build credibility

CONVERSION DESIGN:
- Only ONE primary CTA per page (don't confuse with multiple competing offers)
- CTA should appear at least twice: once above the fold, once near the bottom
- Use benefit-driven CTA text ("Start Your Transformation" not "Submit")
- Remove distractions on landing pages - minimal navigation, no sidebar

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Ensure text size is large enough for the 38+ audience (16px minimum body, 18px preferred)
- High contrast is essential - pretty but unreadable helps nobody
- Simple, clean layouts - don't assume tech-savviness
- Make the next step obvious - what do they click? Where do they go?

SMART PROMPTING GUIDE: Funnel Pages, Landing Pages & Sales Pages
Who This Is For
If you're building pages for a personal development, coaching, wellness, consulting, or any service-based business - this section is your shortcut. These are ready-to-use (or easy-to-customize) prompts that you can paste directly into SuperDesign's chatbox or CLI to generate the exact type of page you need.
Most people in this space need the same core pages. You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Start with one of these, customize the details, and you're designing in seconds instead of staring at a blank screen.

BEFORE YOU PROMPT: The 5 Questions Every AI Agent Must Ask First
If you are an AI agent (OpenClaw, Claude, or any assistant), you MUST gather this information before generating any SuperDesign prompt. These are easy, softball questions - do NOT overwhelm the user. Ask them conversationally, one or two at a time.
Question 1: What are you building?
"What kind of page do you need? For example: a landing page, a sales page, a booking page, a checkout page, or a full website?"
Why this matters: The page type determines the section structure, the CTA style, and the overall layout.
Question 2: What are your brand colors?
"Do you have specific brand colors? If so, what are they? (Hex codes are perfect, but even 'purple and gold' works.)"
If they don't have brand colors: Suggest a palette based on their industry and vibe. For wellness/coaching, warm tones work well - deep plum, gold, cream, sage green, warm coral. Offer 2-3 palette options.
Question 3: Where will this page live? (CRITICAL for code compatibility)
"Where are you going to host this page? For example: Go High Level, Convert & Flow, WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Squarespace, Vercel, or somewhere else?"
Why this is critical: The hosting platform determines what type of code you export and how it needs to be formatted. See the Hosting Compatibility Guide below.
Question 4: What's the ONE thing you want visitors to do?
"When someone lands on this page, what's the one action you want them to take? Book a call? Join a membership? Download a freebie? Buy something?"
Why this matters: This determines CTA button text, CTA placement, and how many times the CTA repeats.
Question 5: Who is this page for?
"Describe the person who's going to see this page. What are they struggling with? What do they want?"
Why this matters: This shapes the headline copy, the benefit language, and the emotional tone of the design. You don't need a full avatar - even a sentence helps: "Burned out professional women who want to finally put themselves first."

OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (Only Ask If Needed)
"Do you have a logo I can use?" (If building a full page with header/footer)
"Do you have testimonials or client quotes I can include?" (For sales or landing pages)
"What's your price point?" (For sales pages or checkout pages)
"Do you have a headshot or photo you'd like on the page?" (For about or speaker pages)
"Is there a website you've seen that you LOVE the look of?" (For design direction - can clone it)

ADDITIONAL PROMPT IDEAS (Quick Templates)
For these, use the same structure as above but swap in the relevant details:

HOSTING COMPATIBILITY GUIDE
Why This Matters
The code SuperDesign generates MUST be compatible with wherever the page is going to live. Different platforms accept different types of code. If you export the wrong format, the page will either look broken or won't load at all.
AI Agents: You MUST ask where the page will be hosted BEFORE exporting code from SuperDesign. This is not optional.

GO HIGH LEVEL (GHL) / CONVERT & FLOW
Go High Level (and its white-label clones like Convert & Flow) uses a drag-and-drop page builder with a custom code block element. This is the most common hosting platform for the coaches, consultants, and service providers in this space.
How to Use SuperDesign Code in GHL
Method 1: Code Block Element (Recommended)
In GHL, go to Sites → Funnels (or Websites)
Open (or create) your funnel/website
Open the page in the builder
Add a new Section → add a Row → add a Code Element (sometimes called "Custom JS/HTML")
Click into the code element
Paste your SuperDesign HTML export into the code editor
Click Save, then preview
Method 2: Full Page Code Block
Create a new page in your funnel
Delete ALL default sections (start with a blank page)
Add ONE section with ONE row and ONE Code Element
Paste the ENTIRE SuperDesign HTML export into that single code element
This gives you a fully custom page inside GHL
GHL Code Compatibility Rules
EXPORT FORMAT: HTML + inline CSS (NOT React)

MUST DO:
✅ All CSS must be INLINE or in a <style> tag within the same code block
✅ Keep <script> tags SEPARATE from <div> tags (GHL restriction)
✅ Use inline styles or a single <style> block - GHL's custom CSS panel only affects one page at a time
✅ Self-contained code - everything in one block, no external file references
✅ Test in GHL's preview mode before publishing

MUST NOT:
❌ Do NOT export React code - GHL doesn't support React components
❌ Do NOT use external CSS file links (they won't load reliably)
❌ Do NOT use special characters like \n in text (use <br/> instead)
❌ Do NOT rely on JavaScript for core layout - it may conflict with GHL's builder
❌ Do NOT use iframes unless specifically needed (forms, calendars)

WHEN PROMPTING SUPERDESIGN:
Add this to your prompt: "Export as a single self-contained HTML file with all CSS inline or in a <style> tag. No external stylesheets. No React. No JavaScript dependencies. Clean, standalone HTML that can be pasted into a Go High Level code block."
GHL-Specific Prompt Addition
Append this to ANY SuperDesign prompt when the page is going into GHL:
IMPORTANT: This page will be hosted in Go High Level using a code block element. 
Requirements:
- All CSS must be inline or in a single <style> tag
- No external stylesheet links
- No React - pure HTML and CSS only
- Keep all <script> tags separate from <div> tags
- Self-contained code that works when pasted into a single code block
- All images should use placeholder URLs that can be easily swapped
- Forms should use placeholder areas (GHL has its own form builder)
- Do NOT include GHL-specific form code - just leave a clearly marked area where the GHL form embed will go
CONVERT & FLOW / GHL: Complete Step-by-Step Deployment Walkthrough
This is the exact click-by-click process for deploying your SuperDesign code into Convert & Flow (or any Go High Level account). If you are an AI agent controlling a browser, follow these steps precisely.
Authentication & Session Management
Open the browser and navigate to the Convert & Flow (or GHL) login page
Enter the user's email and password and log in
SESSION TIP: If you are using Playwright (recommended), the login session will be saved automatically. This means you only need to log in once - future browser sessions will already be authenticated. If the session expires, re-authenticate.
If you do not have the user's login credentials, ask them to log in manually while you watch, or ask them to provide credentials securely
WAIT: Confirm you are fully logged in and see the dashboard before proceeding
Step 1: Navigate to Sites → Funnels
On the left sidebar, locate and click "Sites"
At the top of the page, you will see tabs: Funnels, Stores, Webinars, Analytics, Quiz, etc.
Click "Funnels" (this is the correct choice 90% of the time)
Only choose "Websites" if the user specifically said they're building a standalone website, not a funnel
WAIT: The funnels list page should load
Step 2: Create a New Funnel
Near the top right of the page, locate the button that says "+ New Funnel"
Click "+ New Funnel"
A modal/popup will appear with options: Blank Funnel, AI, From Templates
Choose "Blank Funnel" (do NOT use AI or templates - you have your own code)
A form will appear asking for the funnel name
Type a clear, descriptive funnel name (e.g., "Soft Life Sanctuary Landing Page" or "Discovery Call Booking Funnel")
Click "Create"
WAIT: The funnel workspace screen will load
Step 3: Add Funnel Steps (One Per Page)
On the workspace screen, you will see a button that says "Add New Step" or "Import"
Click "Add New Step"
A form will appear asking for:
Step Name: Give it a clear name aligned with the page purpose (e.g., "Landing Page", "Sales Page", "Checkout", "Thank You")
Step Path: This is the URL path (e.g., /landing, /sales, /checkout, /thank-you). Make this unique and descriptive. Use lowercase with hyphens.
Click "Create Funnel Step" (black button)
REPEAT steps 19-21 for EACH page in the funnel. If the funnel has 4 pages (opt-in → sales → checkout → thank you), create 4 steps.
WAIT: The workspace screen will update showing your funnel steps
Step 4: Open the Page Builder
Click on the funnel step you want to build first
You will see two boxes in the middle of the screen
Click "Create from Blank" (the large button)
WAIT 5 SECONDS - The page builder takes a moment to load. Do NOT click anything during this time.
The builder interface will appear
Step 5: Dismiss the AI Assistant
On the left side of the builder, you will see a popup that says "Ask AI" with an X button
Click the X button to close the AI assistant - you do not need it
The builder canvas should now be clear and ready
Step 6: Add a Blank Section
In the middle of the canvas, click the button that says "Blank Section"
A blank section will be added to the page (you'll see a green-outlined area)
Step 7: Add the Code Element
In the middle of the blank section, you'll see a green box with a "+" icon
Hover your mouse over the "+" icon - the word "Add" will appear
Click "Add"
A panel will open on the left side showing available elements
Scroll ALL the way down in the left panel
Under the section labeled "Custom", locate and click "Code"
A "Custom HTML/JavaScript" element will appear in the middle of the canvas
Step 8: Set Full Width (CRITICAL)
Now you need to find the section settings (the green container, NOT the blue code element):
Move your mouse between the elements in the middle of the canvas
You're looking for a green line or green border to appear (NOT blue)
The blue box is the code element. The green is the section container.
Hover slowly between the top edge of the code element and the section boundary until you see the green highlight
Click on the green line/border when it appears
The section settings panel will open on the right side
Find the option that says "Allow rows to take entire width"
Turn this ON (toggle/switch it to enabled)
This ensures your design takes up the full page width instead of being constrained to a narrow column
Step 9: Paste Your Code
Now click on the blue box that says "Custom HTML/JavaScript" in the middle of the canvas
The right panel will update to show element settings
Find and click the button that says "Open Code Editor"
A black code editor window will open
Paste the ENTIRE SuperDesign HTML export into this code editor
This is all the HTML, CSS (in <style> tags), and any JavaScript
Paste the complete, self-contained code - do not split it across multiple elements
Click "Save" in the code editor to close it
Step 10: Save the Page
In the top right corner of the builder, locate the save button - it looks like a floppy disk icon and is positioned next to the word "Publish"
Click the floppy disk save button
WAIT: Confirm the page saves (you may see a brief success notification)
Step 11: Preview and Verify
To the right of the save button, you will see an eyeball icon (preview)
Click the eyeball icon
A preview window or new tab will open showing your live page
VERIFY the following:
[ ] All sections render correctly (no broken layouts)
[ ] Text is readable and properly formatted
[ ] Colors match the brand specifications
[ ] Images load (or have proper placeholder indicators)
[ ] The page is responsive - check at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths
[ ] CTA buttons are visible and properly styled
[ ] No horizontal scrolling on any device size
[ ] No elements are cut off or overlapping
Step 12: Debug If Needed
If the page does NOT render correctly:
Take note of what's wrong (broken layout, missing styles, overlapping elements, etc.)
Go back to the code editor (click the code element → "Open Code Editor")
Copy the code out
Use Claude Opus 4.6 (or the best available thinking model) to analyze and fix the code
Paste the fixed code back into the code editor
Save and preview again
Repeat until the page renders correctly
Common GHL rendering issues and fixes:
Page is narrow/not full width → You forgot Step 8. Go back and turn on "Allow rows to take entire width"
Styles are missing → CSS may have been stripped. Ensure all CSS is in a <style> tag inside the code block
<script> error → Scripts must be OUTSIDE of <div> tags in GHL. Separate them.
Fonts not loading → GHL may block external font CDN links. Use GHL's built-in font settings or embed fonts as base64
Page refreshing infinitely → A JavaScript conflict. Remove all custom JavaScript and test. Re-add scripts one at a time.
Special characters showing as code → Replace \n with <br/> and escape any special characters
Step 13: Repeat for Additional Funnel Pages
Go back to the funnel workspace (navigate back or use the breadcrumb)
Click on the next funnel step
Repeat Steps 24-61 for each page in the funnel
Each page gets its own code element with its own SuperDesign HTML export
Step 14: Publish (When Ready)
Once all pages are built, saved, and verified:
On each page, click the "Publish" button in the top right of the builder
Or from the funnel workspace, publish the entire funnel
IMPORTANT: Do NOT publish until the user has reviewed and approved all pages

WORDPRESS
WordPress sites typically use themes with page builders (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg, etc.).
How to Use SuperDesign Code in WordPress
Method 1: Custom HTML Block (Gutenberg)
Create or edit a page
Add a "Custom HTML" block
Paste the SuperDesign HTML export
Preview
Method 2: Elementor HTML Widget
Open the page in Elementor
Add an "HTML" widget
Paste the code
For CSS, add to Elementor's Custom CSS panel or include inline
Method 3: Full Custom Page Template
Create a custom page template file (.php)
Include the SuperDesign HTML within the template
This gives you full control but requires basic WordPress knowledge
WordPress Code Compatibility Rules
EXPORT FORMAT: HTML + CSS (standalone)

MUST DO:
✅ Include all CSS inline or in a <style> tag
✅ Make images responsive (max-width: 100%)
✅ Test that the code doesn't conflict with the WordPress theme's existing CSS
✅ Use unique class names to avoid CSS conflicts with the theme

WATCH OUT FOR:
⚠ WordPress themes may override your fonts, colors, and spacing
⚠ If using a page builder, the code block may have width constraints
⚠ Some WordPress security plugins block inline scripts

WHEN PROMPTING SUPERDESIGN:
Add: "Export as standalone HTML with all CSS in a <style> tag. Use unique class names prefixed with 'sd-' to avoid CSS conflicts with WordPress themes. No external dependencies."

SHOPIFY
Shopify has its own theme system built on Liquid templates.
SuperDesign + Shopify
SuperDesign has a direct Shopify theme export option in the web app. Use this when available.
If using manual HTML export:
Go to Online Store → Themes → Edit Code
Create a new page template
Paste the HTML into the template
Or use a "Custom Liquid" section in the theme editor
EXPORT FORMAT: Shopify theme export (preferred) or HTML

WHEN PROMPTING:
Add: "Export as a Shopify-compatible theme or as clean HTML that can be embedded in a Shopify Liquid template."

VERCEL / NETLIFY (Developer Platforms)
These are deployment platforms for developers. If someone says "Vercel" or "Netlify," they likely have development experience or a developer on their team.
EXPORT FORMAT: React code (preferred) or HTML

These platforms support:
✅ React components (Next.js on Vercel)
✅ Static HTML sites
✅ Full CSS frameworks (Tailwind, etc.)
✅ External dependencies
✅ JavaScript

WHEN PROMPTING:
Add: "Export as a React component with Tailwind CSS classes. Production-ready for Next.js deployment on Vercel."

WIX / SQUARESPACE
These drag-and-drop builders have limited custom code support.
EXPORT FORMAT: HTML (limited)

LIMITATIONS:
⚠ Wix: Custom code goes in "Embed HTML" widget - has iframe sandboxing that limits what renders
⚠ Squarespace: Code blocks are available but CSS may conflict with the template
⚠ Both platforms: You lose responsive control - the platform handles mobile differently

RECOMMENDATION: For Wix/Squarespace users, it's often better to use SuperDesign as VISUAL REFERENCE (inspiration for manually building in their platform's builder) rather than trying to paste code directly. Export the style.md and use it as a design guide while building natively in their editor.

KAJABI
Kajabi is popular for course creators and coaches.
EXPORT FORMAT: HTML (with limitations)

HOW: Use Kajabi's Custom Code block in their page builder
LIMITATIONS: Similar to GHL - inline CSS preferred, limited JavaScript support
WHEN PROMPTING: Same rules as GHL - self-contained HTML with inline CSS


The Three Layers of SuperDesign (And What Each Actually Uses)
Before installing anything, you need to understand what's really happening under the hood. SuperDesign is NOT one thing - it's three layers, and they don't all use the same resources.
Layer 1: The Web App (app.superdesign.dev)
What it uses: SuperDesign's servers, SuperDesign's AI model (Gemini 3), SuperDesign's computing power
Credits: Limited free credits per week. When you run out, you're locked out until they reset or you upgrade to Pro.
Unique capability: The Chrome extension for one-click site cloning. This is the ONE thing you can't do anywhere else.
Best for: Cloning websites, visual canvas work, point-and-click design, people who want a visual interface
Layer 2: The CLI + Skill Repository (superdesigndev/superdesign-skill)
What it uses: Also connects to SuperDesign's API backend for canvas-related commands (create-project, iterate-design-draft). These commands likely use the SAME credit pool as the web app.
Credits: Shared with the web app for canvas/design commands. BUT - inspiration commands (search-prompts, get-prompts, extract-brand-guide) may not consume design credits.
Unique capability: Batch operations, multi-page flow generation, scriptable automation, integration with coding agents
Best for: AI agents that need to automate design workflows, batch variation generation, developers
Layer 3: The IDE Extension (VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf)
What it uses: YOUR OWN AI API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter). Designs generate LOCALLY using YOUR API credits - NOT SuperDesign's credits.
Credits: Unlimited design generation (as long as you're paying for your own API access - typically pennies per generation)
Limitations: No Chrome extension cloning. No browser-based canvas. Everything happens inside the code editor.
Best for: Unlimited design generation without worrying about SuperDesign's weekly credit limits
The Honest Comparison
The Bottom Line
The skill repository alone does NOT bypass the web app's credit limits for core design generation. The CLI commands that create and iterate designs talk to the same backend as the web app.
HOWEVER - the IDE extension (which the skill integrates with) uses YOUR OWN API key, meaning unlimited generation. And you can combine approaches strategically to minimize credit usage.

THE SMART HYBRID WORKFLOW (Save Credits, Maximize Output)
Here's how to get maximum value while using the least web app credits:
Strategy: Use the Web App for What ONLY It Can Do. Use the Skill/IDE for Everything Else.
Step 1 - Clone with the Web App (uses credits, but only once per site)
Use the Chrome extension to clone a reference site
This is the ONE thing only the web app can do
One clone = one credit usage = your starting point
Step 2 - Export the Style.md Immediately
Before doing anything else, export the style.md from your cloned design
This captures the entire design DNA: colors, fonts, spacing, component styles
Save this file locally - it's your reusable design rulebook
Step 3 - Switch to the Skill / IDE for All Remaining Work
Take your style.md and use it as the --set-project-prompt-file in CLI commands
OR open it in your IDE with the SuperDesign extension
Generate ALL variations, iterations, and additional pages using your own API key
You're now designing unlimited pages that match the cloned design - without burning web app credits
Step 4 - Use extract-brand-guide for Additional Reference Sites
Instead of cloning every reference site (which uses web app credits), use the CLI command extract-brand-guide --urlto capture design DNA from multiple sites
This gives you colors, fonts, and spacing tokens - not the full layout, but enough to inform your design prompts
Combine extracted brand elements into your design system file
Step 5 - Generate All Funnel Pages Locally
With your style.md + brand guide, use the IDE extension or CLI to generate every page in your funnel
Landing page, sales page, checkout, thank you - all generated locally
No web app credits consumed after the initial clone
Credit-Saving Cheat Sheet
Result: Instead of using 20+ web app credits to build a full funnel, you use 1-2 credits (for the initial clone) and do everything else locally.

INSTALLING THE SUPERDESIGN SKILL REPOSITORY
What You're Installing
The official SuperDesign skill package from GitHub. This gives AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or OpenClaw) the ability to use SuperDesign's CLI commands directly and follow SuperDesign's official standard operating procedures.
Repository: https://github.com/superdesigndev/superdesign-skill
Prerequisites
Before installing, you need:
Node.js version 16 or higher (node --version to check)
npm (comes with Node.js)
A terminal / command line
If Node.js is not installed:
# Mac (using Homebrew)
apt-get install -y node

# Windows (download from)
# https://nodejs.org - download the LTS version

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Verify installation
node --version    # Should show v16+ 
npm --version     # Should show 8+
Step 1: Install the SuperDesign CLI
# Install the CLI tool globally
npm install -g @superdesign/cli@latest

# Verify it installed correctly
superdesign --version
If you get a "permission denied" error on Mac/Linux:
sudo npm install -g @superdesign/cli@latest
Step 2: Install the Skill Package
# Install the skill for your coding agent
npx skills add superdesigndev/superdesign-skill
This downloads the skill files and places them where your coding agent can access them. It includes:
CLI command definitions
Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
Agent rules and workflows
Slash command: /superdesign
Step 3: Configure Your AI Provider (For IDE Extension)
If you want to use the IDE extension for LOCAL generation (no SuperDesign credits):
# In VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf:
# 1. Open Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X)
# 2. Search "SuperDesign"
# 3. Install the extension
# 4. Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
# 5. Run: superdesign: configureApiKey
# 6. Enter your AI provider API key:
#    - Anthropic API key (recommended - claude models)
#    - OpenAI API key
#    - OpenRouter API key

# 7. Initialize the project in your workspace:
# Cmd+Shift+P → superdesign: initializeProject
This creates the .superdesign/ folder in your project and sets up IDE-specific rule files.
Step 4: Verify Everything Works
# Test the CLI
superdesign search-prompts --keyword "landing page" --json

# Test brand extraction
superdesign extract-brand-guide --url https://example.com --json

# If both return JSON results, you're good to go
In your IDE:
# Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
# Run: superdesign: open canva
# If the canvas panel opens, the IDE extension is working

USING THE SKILL REPOSITORY: Complete Workflow
For AI Agents (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor)
Once the skill is installed, agents can use the /superdesign slash command or call CLI commands directly.
Workflow A: Design a New Page Using the Skill
# Step 1: Set up the design system (if it doesn't exist yet)
# Option A - Extract from a reference site:
superdesign extract-brand-guide --url https://reference-site.com --json > .superdesign/design-system.md

# Option B - Create manually by writing a design system file:
# Create .superdesign/design-system.md with brand colors, fonts, spacing rules

# Step 2: Search for design inspiration (optional)
superdesign search-prompts --keyword "wellness coaching landing page" --json
superdesign search-prompts --tags "style" --keyword "premium warm" --json

# Step 3: Create the project
superdesign create-project \
  --title "Soft Life Sanctuary Landing Page" \
  --set-project-prompt-file .superdesign/design-system.md \
  --json
# SAVE the draftId from the response - you need it for everything else

# Step 4: Generate variations
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <draftId> \
  -p "Warm plum and gold, generous whitespace, luxury feel" \
  -p "Soft earth tones, organic shapes, calming energy" \
  -p "Bold dark background with gold accents, dramatic contrast" \
  --mode branch \
  --json

# Step 5: Review variations
superdesign gallery
# Opens interactive HTML gallery in browser - compare all versions

# Step 6: Refine the best version
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <selected-draftId> \
  -p "Add more breathing room between sections. Make the CTA button larger and more prominent." \
  --mode replace \
  --json

# Step 7: Get the final HTML
superdesign get-design --draft-id <final-draftId> --output ./final-design.html
Workflow B: Clone a Site, Then Work Locally
# Step 1: Extract the brand guide from the target site (CLI - no web app credits)
superdesign extract-brand-guide --url https://site-to-reference.com --json > .superdesign/design-system.md

# Step 2: Clone the LAYOUT using the web app Chrome extension (this is the one step that requires the web app)
# → Open Chrome → navigate to the target site → click SuperDesign extension → Clone Page
# → In the web app canvas, export the HTML and the style.md
# → Save both files locally

# Step 3: Create a project from the cloned HTML
superdesign create-project \
  --title "Cloned Redesign" \
  --html-file ./cloned-site.html \
  --set-project-prompt-file .superdesign/design-system.md \
  --json

# Step 4: All remaining work happens locally
# Generate variations, iterate, build additional pages - all using CLI or IDE extension
# No more web app credits needed
Workflow C: Build an Entire Funnel (Multi-Page)
# Step 1: Set up design system
superdesign extract-brand-guide --url https://reference-site.com --json > .superdesign/design-system.md

# Step 2: Create the project
superdesign create-project \
  --title "Complete Sales Funnel" \
  --set-project-prompt-file .superdesign/design-system.md \
  --json

# Step 3: Use execute-flow-pages to generate the entire funnel at once
superdesign execute-flow-pages \
  --draft-id <draftId> \
  --pages '[
    {"title": "Opt-In Landing Page", "prompt": "Lead capture with email form, freebie headline, 3 benefits"},
    {"title": "Sales Page", "prompt": "Long-form sales with problem, solution, testimonials, pricing at $197/month, FAQ"},
    {"title": "Checkout Page", "prompt": "Clean checkout with order summary, payment form placeholder, trust badges, guarantee"},
    {"title": "Thank You Page", "prompt": "Celebration page with next steps, community invite, social sharing"}
  ]' \
  --json

# Step 4: Review all pages
superdesign gallery

# Step 5: Iterate on individual pages as needed
superdesign iterate-design-draft \
  --draft-id <specific-page-draftId> \
  -p "Make the testimonial section more prominent" \
  --mode replace \
  --json

# Step 6: Export each page
superdesign get-design --draft-id <landing-draftId> --output ./funnel/landing.html
superdesign get-design --draft-id <sales-draftId> --output ./funnel/sales.html
superdesign get-design --draft-id <checkout-draftId> --output ./funnel/checkout.html
superdesign get-design --draft-id <thankyou-draftId> --output ./funnel/thankyou.html
Workflow D: Using the /superdesign Slash Command in Any Agent
Once the skill is installed, you can use it conversationally:
/superdesign help me design a premium landing page for a wellness membership

/superdesign extract the brand guide from https://example.com

/superdesign create 3 variations of this page with different color schemes

/superdesign build a 4-page sales funnel: opt-in, sales page, checkout, thank you
The agent will translate your request into the appropriate CLI commands and execute them.

SKILL REPOSITORY: WHAT TO ADD TO YOUR OPENCLAW SKILL FILE
If you're using OpenClaw, update or create the skill file at /data/.openclaw/skills/superdesign-skill/SKILL.md:
---
name: superdesign-skill
description: Official SuperDesign skill for designing websites via CLI and IDE. Handles design generation, site cloning workflows, brand extraction, multi-page funnels, and code export. Uses hybrid approach - web app for cloning, CLI/IDE for unlimited local generation.


SUPERDESIGN MCP SERVER (Community-Built - For Claude Code Users)
A community developer (jonthebeef) built an MCP server that gives Claude Code native tool access to SuperDesign's design capabilities.
Repository: https://github.com/jonthebeef/superdesign-mcp-claude-code Playbooks page:https://playbooks.com/mcp/jonthebeef-superdesign-mcp-claude-code
What it is: A local MCP server that exposes 5 SuperDesign tools directly inside Claude Code - no API keys needed. Claude Code can call superdesign_generate, superdesign_iterate, superdesign_extract_system, superdesign_list, and superdesign_gallery as native tools.
Setup:
npm install
npm run build
Then add to Claude Code's MCP config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superdesign": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/superdesign/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
Who needs this: Developers using Claude Code who want the deepest possible integration - design generation without leaving the terminal or copying prompts.
Who does NOT need this: Non-technical users. If you're using SuperDesign through the web app or having an AI agent operate it for you, you don't need the MCP server.

ADVANCED: SuperDesign Inside Your IDE
This section is for people who know what an IDE is and want to use one. If the words "VS Code," "Cursor," or "Windsurf" mean nothing to you, skip this entire section - the Web App and CLI workflows above have you covered. But if you live inside a code editor and want the deepest possible SuperDesign integration with UNLIMITED design generation using YOUR OWN API key (not SuperDesign's credits), keep reading.

What IDEs Work with SuperDesign?
SuperDesign's IDE extension is built as a VS Code extension. Because Cursor and Windsurf are both forks of VS Code (they're built on the same foundation), the extension works in all three. Claude Code integrates differently - through the terminal and a dedicated CLAUDE.md rules file.
Here's every IDE that works:
VS Code (Free - Mac, Windows, Linux)
Download: https://code.visualstudio.com
VS Code is Microsoft's free code editor and it runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It's the most widely used code editor in the world - over 70% of developers use it. There is no Apple-exclusive IDE for web development - VS Code IS the standard for Mac users. If you're on a Mac and someone says "open your IDE," they almost certainly mean VS Code.
SuperDesign installs directly from the VS Code Extension Marketplace. Full support - chat sidebar, canvas panel, all commands.
Cursor ($20/month Pro - Mac, Windows, Linux)
Download: https://cursor.com
Cursor is a VS Code fork with built-in AI. It looks and works exactly like VS Code but has a powerful AI agent mode baked in. Because it's a VS Code fork, SuperDesign's extension installs the same way.
Cursor bonus: When you initialize SuperDesign in Cursor, it creates a .cursor/rules/design.mdc file - a Cursor-specific rules file that teaches Cursor's AI agent how to design using SuperDesign. The SuperDesign team recommends copying the prompt from design.mdc and creating a custom mode in Cursor with that same system prompt for better performance.
Windsurf ($15/month Pro - Mac, Windows, Linux)
Download: https://windsurf.com (formerly Codeium)
Windsurf is another VS Code fork, known for its "Cascade" agent that handles multi-file tasks. SuperDesign creates a .windsurfrules file during initialization that teaches Windsurf's agent how to work with SuperDesign.
Windsurf was acquired by Cognition AI (the company behind Devin) in late 2025. It's actively developed and well-supported.
Claude Code (Terminal-Based - Mac, Linux)
Claude Code isn't a visual IDE - it's Anthropic's command-line coding tool. But SuperDesign integrates with it through a CLAUDE.md rules file that gets created during initialization. This file teaches Claude Code's agent how to generate designs, use the canvas, and follow the SuperDesign workflow.
If you're already using Claude Code for development work, this integration means you can design pages without ever leaving the terminal.
GitHub Codespaces (Cloud-Based VS Code in Your Browser)
Access: https://github.com/codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is VS Code running in the cloud - you access it through your web browser. Because it's VS Code under the hood, you can install the SuperDesign extension from the marketplace just like the desktop version. Useful if you work across multiple machines or prefer not to install anything locally.
Quick Comparison
Bottom line: If you're not sure, just download VS Code. It's free, it works on your Mac or PC, and everything in this guide works inside it.

Setting Up SuperDesign in Your IDE (Step by Step)
Step 1: Install Your IDE
Download and install one of the IDEs above. If you don't have a preference, use VS Code.
Step 2: Install the SuperDesign Extension
In VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf:
Open the IDE
Press Cmd+Shift+X (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) to open the Extensions panel
Search for "SuperDesign"
Look for the one published by SuperdesignDev (the official extension - the old one by "iganbold" is deprecated)
Click Install
In GitHub Codespaces: Same process - the Extension Marketplace is available in the browser version.
In Claude Code: No extension to install. Claude Code integration happens through the CLAUDE.md file created during project initialization (Step 4 below).
Step 3: Configure Your AI Provider API Key
This is the critical step that unlocks UNLIMITED design generation. You're telling SuperDesign to use YOUR AI account instead of their credits.
Press Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette
Type: superdesign: configureApiKey
Select it and enter your API key
Which API key to use:
To set the provider:
Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
Type: superdesign: openSettings
Find AI Model Provider and set it to anthropic (or openai / openrouter)
Optionally set a specific model name in AI Model
Pro tip: Anthropic's Claude is the default and recommended provider. A typical design generation costs pennies - you could generate 100 designs for about $1-5 depending on complexity.
Step 4: Initialize Your Project
This is the step that creates all the configuration files SuperDesign needs.
Open your project folder in the IDE (or create a new empty folder)
Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
Type: superdesign: initializeProject
Press Enter
What this creates:
your-project/
├── .superdesign/                    ← SuperDesign's working directory
│   ├── design_iterations/           ← All generated HTML/CSS/SVG designs go here
│   ├── moodboard/                   ← Upload reference images here
│   └── default_ui_darkmode.css      ← Default stylesheet
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       └── design.mdc              ← Cursor-specific rules (Cursor only)
├── CLAUDE.md                        ← Claude Code rules (all IDEs)
└── .windsurfrules                   ← Windsurf-specific rules (Windsurf only)
These files are the key to the whole thing. Let's break down what each one does and what to put in them.
Step 5: Install the Skill Repository (For Deepest Integration)
After initializing the project, install the official skill package to give your IDE's AI agent the full SuperDesign command library:
# Open the terminal inside your IDE (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`)

# Install the SuperDesign CLI
npm install -g @superdesign/cli@latest

# Install the skill repository
npx skills add superdesigndev/superdesign-skill
Now your IDE's AI agent knows every SuperDesign command, workflow, and best practice. You can prompt it naturally: "Design a landing page for a wellness membership" and it'll use SuperDesign's full toolkit.

The .MD Rules Files: What They Do and What to Put in Them
When you run initializeProject, SuperDesign creates rules files that teach your IDE's AI agent how to design. These are the most important files in your setup - they're the instruction manual your AI reads before doing any design work.
CLAUDE.md (Used by Claude Code and as a general reference)
Location: your-project/CLAUDE.md
What it does: This file is read by Claude Code (and other Claude-based tools) every time it starts a session in your project. It tells Claude how to use SuperDesign's tools, what workflow to follow, and what design standards to maintain.
What's already in it (auto-generated): The default CLAUDE.md includes SuperDesign's four-step gated design workflow, tool usage rules, and basic styling guidelines (Flowbite components, responsive design, color palettes).
What to ADD to it for your business:
Add a section at the bottom of the file (don't delete what's already there) with your brand and business context:
## PROJECT-SPECIFIC DESIGN RULES

### Brand Identity
- Primary colors: [your hex codes - e.g., #5B2C6F, #D4A843, #1A1A2E]
- Secondary colors: [your secondary hex codes]
- Fonts: [your brand fonts - e.g., Playfair Display for headlines, Lato for body]
- Logo: Located in .superdesign/moodboard/logo.png

### Design Standards
- Target audience: [e.g., Professional Black women aged 38+, high-achieving, corporate or entrepreneurial]
- Design feel: [e.g., Warm, premium, luxury but approachable - NOT cold corporate]
- Body text minimum: 16px (audience is 38+, readability matters)
- Use rounded corners, not sharp edges
- Generous whitespace - this is premium wellness, not discount retail
- One primary CTA per page, make it unmissable
- Trust signals early (testimonials, credentials, media logos)
- Mobile-first: everything must stack cleanly below 768px

### Export Requirements
- All CSS must be inline (for Go High Level / Convert & Flow compatibility)
- No React - HTML/CSS only
- No external stylesheet links
- Scripts must be in separate tags from div content
Keep it under 60-80 lines total (including the auto-generated content). The AI reads this every session - if it's too long, it loses focus on the important parts.
.cursor/rules/design.mdc (Cursor Only)
Location: your-project/.cursor/rules/design.mdc
What it does: This is Cursor's rules format. Cursor reads .mdc files in the .cursor/rules/ folder and uses them as system-level instructions. When you ask Cursor's agent to design something, it reads this file first.
What's already in it: The same SuperDesign workflow and design guidelines as CLAUDE.md, formatted for Cursor's rules system.
What to ADD: Same brand-specific content as above - your colors, fonts, audience, design feel, and export requirements. Add it at the bottom of the file.
Cursor Pro Tip: The SuperDesign team specifically recommends creating a Custom Mode in Cursor using the design.mdc prompt:
Open Cursor Settings
Go to Custom Modes (or access via Command Palette)
Create a new mode called "SuperDesign"
Paste the contents of design.mdc as the system prompt
Now when you switch to "SuperDesign" mode, every prompt is design-optimized
This gives noticeably better design results because the system prompt is loaded BEFORE every message instead of only when Cursor notices the rules file.
.windsurfrules (Windsurf Only)
Location: your-project/.windsurfrules
What it does: Windsurf reads this file as project-level instructions for its Cascade agent. Same concept as Cursor's rules - it tells Windsurf's AI how to use SuperDesign.
What's already in it: The standard SuperDesign workflow and design guidelines.
What to ADD: Same brand-specific additions as above. Add at the bottom.
Rules File Summary
The golden rule: Don't overload these files. Keep your additions to 20-30 lines of brand-specific rules. The AI needs clear, scannable instructions - not a novel. If you have extensive brand guidelines, put them in a separate file (like .superdesign/brand-guide.md) and reference it from the rules file with a note like: "For full brand guidelines, read .superdesign/brand-guide.md before starting any design."

Using SuperDesign in Your IDE (Day-to-Day Workflow)
Once everything is set up, here's how you actually USE it:
Opening the Chat Sidebar
Look for the SuperDesign icon in your left sidebar (it appears after installation)
Click it to open the chat panel
Type your design request in natural language
Opening the Canvas
Press Cmd+Shift+P → type superdesign: open canva
The canvas panel opens in your editor - this is where designs render in real-time
As the AI generates HTML/CSS files, the canvas updates automatically
The Four-Step Design Flow
SuperDesign enforces a gated workflow - it won't rush ahead without your approval at each stage:
Step 1 - Clarify: The AI asks clarifying questions about your design requirements. Answer them.
Step 2 - Plan: The AI presents a design plan - layout structure, section order, color usage. Review it and approve or adjust.
Step 3 - Generate: The AI creates the actual HTML/CSS files. They appear in .superdesign/design_iterations/ and render on the canvas.
Step 4 - Iterate: You review the design on the canvas and request changes. "Make the hero section taller." "Change the CTA color to gold." "Add more whitespace between sections." Each request generates an updated version.
Key Commands (Command Palette)
Working with the Generated Files
Everything SuperDesign creates lives in .superdesign/design_iterations/. These are standard HTML, CSS, and SVG files. You can:
Open them in a browser to preview
Copy the HTML into Go High Level / Convert & Flow (following the deployment instructions earlier in this guide)
Edit them manually if you want to tweak something the AI missed
Use them as templates for future designs
Adding Reference Images (Moodboard)
If you have screenshots, logos, or design references you want the AI to see:
Drop them into .superdesign/moodboard/
Reference them in your prompt: "Use the color palette from the reference image in the moodboard"
The AI can read these images and use them to inform design decisions
