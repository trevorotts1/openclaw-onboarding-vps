╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  MANDATORY TYP CHECK - READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
  DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS CHECK IS COMPLETE.
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP 1: CHECK IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE TEACH YOURSELF PROTOCOL (TYP)

Before you read, learn, or execute ANY instruction in this document, you must
verify that you have already been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP).

HOW TO CHECK:
- Look in your AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or MEMORY.md for any mention of:
  "Teach Yourself Protocol" or "TYP"
- Look in your session context for prior TYP training
- Look for a tab called "Teach Yourself Protocol" in this same document

IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
Proceed to the instructions below. Follow the TYP file storage structure.

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further. Do not attempt to learn or execute
anything in this document. Tell the user exactly this:

  "I have not been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol yet. I cannot safely
   learn or execute these instructions until I have been taught TYP first.
   Please share the Teach Yourself Protocol tab with me before we proceed.
   Without TYP, I will bloat your core .md files and waste your tokens."

DO NOT PROCEED PAST THIS POINT WITHOUT TYP CONFIRMED.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  TYP FILE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS (only read this if TYP confirmed)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHEN LEARNING THIS DOCUMENT, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:

1. SAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION TO MASTER FILES FOLDER
   Find the OpenClaw master files folder in ~/Downloads/. It may be named:
   - OpenClaw Master Files
   - OpenClaw Master Documents
   - OpenClaw Documents
   - openclaw-master-files
   - openclaw master files
   - OpenClaw Files
   - openclaw-documents
   - Any variation of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents"
   Search case-insensitively. One word or two words. Plural or singular.
   If no folder is found, create: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/

   Save this full document content as a .md file in that folder.

2. DO NOT DUMP FULL CONTENT INTO CORE .MD FILES
   AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md must stay lean.
   Only add a brief summary and a file path reference to where the full
   documentation lives. Never paste thousands of lines into core files.

3. USE THE LABELED SECTIONS BELOW TO KNOW WHAT GOES WHERE
   Look for sections marked:
   [ADD TO AGENTS.md]
   [ADD TO TOOLS.md]
   [ADD TO MEMORY.md]
   Only add what is labeled. Nothing else goes into core files.

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY BEFORE YOU START
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

These rules apply every single time you execute instructions from this document.
No exceptions. No shortcuts. No improvising.

RULE 1: READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Read this entire document from top to bottom before executing a single step.
Do not start executing while still reading. Finish reading first. Then start.

RULE 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE OPERATOR'S INTENT
These instructions say exactly what to do. Execute them exactly as written.
- Do NOT reinterpret steps
- Do NOT "improve" the instructions
- Do NOT skip steps because they seem unnecessary
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the document
- Do NOT change the order of steps
If a step says do X, do X. Not Y. Not a better version of X. X.

RULE 3: NEVER MODIFY THESE WITHOUT PERMISSION
- API keys - copy them exactly, character for character
- Terminal commands - run them exactly as written, no edits
- Config values - use the exact values specified
- Model names - use the exact names specified, spelling matters
- File paths - use the exact paths specified
If you are unsure whether something should be changed, the answer is NO.
Ask the operator. Do not guess. Do not assume.

RULE 4: BUILD YOUR CHECKLIST BEFORE EXECUTING
Before you run a single command or make a single change, create a numbered
checklist of every action this document requires you to take. Write it out.
Show it to the user before starting. Get confirmation. Then execute.

RULE 5: CHECK YOURSELF AGAINST THE CHECKLIST WHEN DONE
When you believe you are finished, go back to your checklist.
Verify every single item was completed. Check it off explicitly.
If anything was missed, complete it before telling the user you are done.
Do NOT tell the user you are done until the checklist is 100% complete.

RULE 6: REPORT WHAT YOU DID
When finished, give the user a clear summary:
- What was completed
- What commands were run
- What files were changed
- Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the checklist was fully satisfied

# Google Workspace Integration - Complete Setup Guide

****
**Last Updated: February 22, 2026**

---

This guide walks you through connecting your Google Workspace to your AI agent (OpenClaw) using a Service Account with Domain-Wide Delegation. No coding experience required - just follow each step exactly.

---

🚀 Quick Setup (Just Tell Your AI This)

If you don't want to do all the steps manually, copy this prompt and send it to your AI assistant:

"Set up Google Workspace integration for me. I need you to:
1. Use Playwright browser automation with launchPersistentContext and store session data in ~/.openclaw/playwright-data/
2. Help me create a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) project
3. Enable the required APIs for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Chat, Forms, Keep, Admin, Analytics, Tag Manager, Search Console, YouTube, Places, and Looker Studio
4. Create a service account with domain-wide delegation
5. Generate and download the service account JSON key
6. Set GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE and GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER
7. Install and configure the GOG skill using the JSON key
8. Test every service in Section 12

Walk me through each step. Ask me for any information you need.
My Google Workspace email is: [YOUR_EMAIL@yourdomain.com]"

Your AI will guide you through the process step-by-step. If you prefer to do it manually, continue with the detailed guide below.

### Browser Agent Mode (Playwright Required)
If you are using OpenClaw browser automation, Playwright is the primary method.
- Always use launchPersistentContext(userDataDir) and store sessions in ~/.openclaw/playwright-data/
- First time login is manual. The agent opens https://admin.google.com and https://console.cloud.google.com. You enter credentials in both tabs.
- Sessions expire after 7 to 14 days. If the agent sees a login screen, it must pause and ask you to re-login.
- Chrome extension is a fallback only. Use it only if Playwright is unavailable.

## 2. Introduction - The Big Picture

### What is Google Cloud Platform?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is Google's infrastructure for developers and businesses. Think of it as Google's "back office" - it is where you set up the technical plumbing that lets apps and tools connect to your Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.).

You do not need to understand cloud computing. You just need to create a project, flip a few switches, and paste some settings. This guide tells you exactly which switches and exactly what to paste.

### What is a Service Account?

A Service Account is a "Robot Identity" - a special Google account created specifically for your AI agent. It is NOT a human account. It has its own email address (like `my-agent@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) and its own cryptographic key file.

> **Analogy:** Think of a Service Account like hiring a virtual assistant. They have their own employee badge (the key file), their own name (the email), but they can only enter the rooms you have given them access to (the scopes).

### What is Domain-Wide Delegation?

Domain-Wide Delegation is the "Security Clearance" that allows the Service Account to act on behalf of a specific human user in your organization.

> **Analogy:** Imagine you own a building. The Service Account is a new employee. Domain-Wide Delegation is you walking to the security desk and saying: "This employee is authorized to enter my office, read my mail, check my calendar, and respond on my behalf - but ONLY for the tasks I have listed here." The "tasks" are the Scopes.

Without Domain-Wide Delegation, the Service Account can only access its own empty mailbox and empty calendar - useless.

### The Two Places You Must Go (Do Not Skip This)

Setting up Google Workspace access requires visiting two completely different websites. This confuses a lot of people, so let us be crystal clear:

#### Place 1: Google Cloud Console

**URL:** [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)

**What it is:** Google's developer/technical dashboard. Think of it as the "construction site" where you build the robot (Service Account) and give it its tools (APIs).

**What you do here (Sections 4-7 of this guide):**

1. Create the Google Cloud Project (the container for everything)
2. Enable all 11 APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Contacts, Tasks, YouTube, Chat, Places)
3. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen (required for sensitive scopes like Gmail)
4. Create the Service Account (the "robot identity")
5. Download the JSON key file (the robot's credential/badge)
6. Find the Client ID - a long number like `115886301121225599053` (you will need this for Place 2)

**Who has access:** Anyone with a Google account can create a project here, but it should be linked to your Workspace organization.

#### Place 2: Google Workspace Admin Console

**URL:** [https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com)

**Direct link to delegation page:** [https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation)

**What it is:** Your organization's security control panel. Think of it as the "security desk" at the front of the building. Only the building owner (Super Admin) can authorize who gets access.

**What you do here (Section 9 of this guide):**

1. Navigate to Security > Access and data control > API controls > Manage Domain Wide Delegation
2. Click "Add new"
3. Paste the Client ID (the number you copied from Place 1)
4. Paste all 70 OAuth Scopes (use the full list below, no spaces)
5. Click Authorize

CRITICAL: Without Domain Wide Delegation, your AI has access to nothing. If you add or change scopes later, you must re-authorize here with the full list.

**Who has access:** ONLY the Google Workspace Super Admin - the person who owns the domain (e.g., `you@yourdomain.com`). If you are not the Super Admin, you will need to ask them to do this step.

### How They Connect

```
PLACE 1 (Cloud Console)              PLACE 2 (Admin Console)
------------------------------       ------------------------------
Create the Project
Enable 11 APIs
Configure OAuth Consent Screen
Create Service Account  --------->   Authorize its Client ID
Download JSON Key                    Paste the 16 Scopes
Copy the Client ID      --------->   Click "Authorize"

"Build the robot and                 "Give it the security
 give it tools"                       clearance to act as you"
```

> **IMPORTANT:** You MUST complete BOTH places. If you only do Place 1, the robot exists but has no permission to act as you. If you only do Place 2, there is no robot to authorize. Both sides must be configured for anything to work.

> **Analogy:** Place 1 (Cloud Console) is where you hire the employee, give them their badge, and assign them tools. Place 2 (Admin Console) is where you walk to the security desk and tell them this employee is authorized to enter your office and do specific tasks on your behalf.

### The Old Way vs. The New Way (Why We Do It This Way)

If you have set up Google integrations before, you may be familiar with creating an OAuth Client ID and Client Secret in Google Cloud. That is the "old way." This guide uses a completely different - and better - approach.

#### The Old Way: OAuth Client ID + Client Secret

This is what most tutorials and tools (including the `gog` CLI) used to have you do:

1. Go to GCP > Credentials > Create OAuth Client ID
2. Get a Client ID and a Client Secret (two text strings)
3. When your app needs access, it opens a browser window
4. You (the human) must click "Allow" on a Google login page
5. Google gives your app a temporary token
6. When the token expires (usually after 1 hour), you must click "Allow" again

**Why this is bad for AI agents:**

- Requires a human to sit at the keyboard and click "Allow"
- Tokens expire and need manual re-authorization
- Cannot run 24/7 without interruption
- If the token expires at 3 AM, your AI stops working until you wake up and re-authorize

#### The New Way: Service Account + JSON Key File

This is what we use in this guide:

1. Go to GCP > Service Accounts > Create Service Account
2. Download a JSON key file (a single file, not two strings)
3. Set up Domain-Wide Delegation in the Admin Console (one-time setup)
4. Your AI agent uses the key file to silently sign a permission slip (JWT)
5. Google verifies the signature and gives back a token - no browser, no "Allow" button, no human needed
6. When the token expires, the AI automatically signs a new one - forever

**Why this is better:**

- Fully automated - no human interaction needed, ever
- Runs 24/7 - tokens refresh silently in the background
- More secure - no password shared, just a cryptographic key file
- One-time setup - configure it once in the Admin Console, never touch it again
- Revocable - delete the key or remove the delegation entry to cut access instantly

#### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Old Way (OAuth Client ID) | New Way (Service Account) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Create in GCP | OAuth Client ID + Client Secret | Service Account + JSON Key File |
| User interaction | Must click "Allow" in browser | None - fully automated |
| Token refresh | Manual - requires browser redirect | Automatic - AI signs a new JWT silently |
| Works 24/7? | No - breaks when token expires | Yes - runs forever |
| Best for | Websites with user login | AI agents, background automation |
| Security | Client Secret can leak as a string | Key file is file-based, easier to secure |
| Setup complexity | Simpler initial setup, painful ongoing | Slightly more setup, zero ongoing maintenance |

> **Bottom line:** The old way is designed for websites where a human is sitting at a computer. The new way is designed for AI agents that need to work silently in the background, 24/7, without ever asking you to click a button. That is why we use it.

### What About the JSON Key File?

The JSON key file is the Service Account's digital ID badge + signature stamp combined into one file. Here is what is inside:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-123",
  "private_key_id": "abc123...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...",
  "client_email": "bot@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "11588630112...",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
}
```

**Field breakdown:**

| Field | What It Is |
|-------|------------|
| `type` | Tells Google this is a robot, not a human |
| `project_id` | Which project it belongs to |
| `private_key_id` | The fingerprint of this specific key |
| `private_key` | The SECRET signing key (most important part) |
| `client_email` | The robot's email address |
| `client_id` | The numeric ID you paste in Admin Console |
| `token_uri` | Where to exchange the JWT for a token |

> **Security:** This file is the equivalent of a master password. Store it securely. Never commit it to Git, share it publicly, or email it unencrypted. If it is ever compromised, immediately delete the key in Google Cloud Console and create a new one.

You still download this file (just like `gog` had you do). The difference is what we do with it:

- **Old `gog` way:** Required the file to be in a specific folder with a specific encoded filename. Had bugs with Gmail.
- **Our way:** You set one environment variable (`GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE`) pointing to wherever you saved the file. The script reads it directly. Simpler, more flexible, no bugs.

### What is Impersonation?

Impersonation is the technical term for "acting as someone else." When your AI agent needs to read your email, it sends a request to Google saying:

> "Hi Google, I am `my-agent@my-project` (the robot), but I am acting on behalf of `you@yourdomain.com`. Here is my signed badge (JWT) to prove I am authorized."

Google checks the Domain-Wide Delegation settings. If the robot is on the approved list with the right scopes, Google gives it a temporary access pass (token) that lasts 1 hour.

> **Security:** Your password is NEVER shared. The Service Account uses cryptographic keys, not passwords. You can revoke access at any time by deleting the delegation entry in your Admin Console.

### What is a JWT?

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a digitally-signed permission slip. Your AI writes a note saying:

> "I am [Service Account], acting on behalf of [Your Email], and I need access to [Gmail]."

It signs that note with its private key (proving it is really who it says it is), hands it to Google, and Google gives back a temporary access pass (token) that lasts 1 hour. When the hour is up, the AI simply writes a new permission slip.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] Google Workspace account (not a free @gmail.com - must be a business/organization account like `you@yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] Google Workspace Super Admin access (required for Domain-Wide Delegation)
- [ ] Node.js v18+ installed on your machine ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- [ ] A computer with terminal/command line access (Mac Terminal, Windows PowerShell, or Linux shell)
- [ ] 15-30 minutes of uninterrupted time

> **IMPORTANT:** If you have a free Gmail account (@gmail.com), this guide will NOT work. You need a Google Workspace business account with a custom domain. See the separate "Personal Gmail Integration Guide" for @gmail.com accounts.

---

## 4. Google Cloud Project Setup

### Step 1: Go to the Google Cloud Console

1. Open your browser and go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google Workspace Super Admin account

### Step 2: Create a New Project

**Direct link:** [https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

1. Click the project dropdown at the very top of the page (it may say "Select a project" or show an existing project name)
2. In the popup window, click **"New Project"** (top right corner)
3. Fill in:
   - **Project name:** Enter a name (e.g., `OpenClaw AI Agent`)
   - **Organization:** Should auto-fill with your domain
   - **Location:** Leave as default
4. Click **Create**
5. Wait a few seconds for the project to be created

### Step 3: Select Your New Project

1. Click the project dropdown again at the top
2. Find and click on your newly created project
3. Confirm it is selected - the project name should now appear in the top bar

> **Note:** Write down your Project ID - it appears under the project name in the dropdown (e.g., `openclaw-ai-agent-123456`). The Project ID is what matters, NOT the display name. They can be different!

### How to Do This Step (Two Options)

**Option A - Playwright Browser Agent (Recommended):**
Your AI agent opens https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate using launchPersistentContext. If you have not logged in yet, the agent will pause and ask you to enter your Google Workspace Super Admin credentials. Once logged in, the agent fills in the project name and clicks Create. Sessions persist for 7 to 14 days, so you only log in once.

**Option B - Chrome Extension (Fallback):**
If Playwright is not available, open Chrome yourself, go to the link above, and follow the numbered steps. Your AI can guide you through each click via the Chrome extension.

### Verification (Do This Before Moving On)

After creating the project, confirm it worked:
1. Look at the top of the Google Cloud Console page. Your new project name should appear in the project dropdown.
2. If you do not see it, click the project dropdown and look in the "Recent" tab.
3. If it is not there at all, wait 30 seconds and refresh the page. Project creation can take a moment.
4. Do not proceed to Section 5 until your project is selected and visible at the top of the page.

---

## 5. Enable the 26 Required APIs

### How to Enable Each API (Two Options)

**Option A - Playwright Browser Agent (Recommended):**
For each API below, the agent navigates to the direct link provided. If the page shows an "Enable" button, the agent clicks it. If the page shows "Manage" instead, the API is already enabled and the agent moves on. After clicking Enable, the agent waits 3 seconds and refreshes the page to confirm the button now says "Manage."

**Option B - Chrome Extension (Fallback):**
Open each direct link in Chrome yourself. Look for the blue "Enable" button and click it. If you see "Manage" instead, it is already on. Move to the next one.

### Verification After Each API

After enabling each API, take a quick look:
- The button should now say **Manage** (not Enable).
- If it still says Enable, click it again. Sometimes Google takes a moment.
- If you get an error, check that your project is selected at the top of the page.

Each Google service has its own API that must be explicitly turned on. Think of it like flipping 26 light switches - each one powers a different room in the building.

> **Before enabling each API:** Look at the top of the page and confirm your correct project is selected. If you enable APIs on the wrong project, nothing will work.

> **Important: YouTube Analytics API does NOT support service accounts.** Google explicitly blocks this. If you need YouTube analytics data, you must use the GOG CLI (OAuth) with a personal Google account that has access to the YouTube channel. The YouTube Data API (Section 5.9) still works fine with service accounts for managing videos, playlists, and channel info - just not for analytics/reporting data.

---

## 6. OAuth Consent Screen

> **CRITICAL:** Without configuring the OAuth Consent Screen, Google will block all sensitive scopes (like Gmail). This is the #1 reason people get stuck with "401 Unauthorized" errors. Do NOT skip this step.

### Why This Step Matters

Google requires every project that accesses user data to have a registered "App." Even though you are using a Service Account (not a traditional app), Google still needs to see an OAuth Consent Screen configured. Without it, sensitive scopes like Gmail will refuse to work.

### Step-by-Step

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)

   **Playwright:** The agent navigates to this URL. If it sees a "Get Started" button, it clicks it. If it sees the consent screen form already, it proceeds to fill it in.
   **Chrome Extension:** Open the link in Chrome yourself and follow along.

2. If you see "Get Started", click it
3. You will be asked to choose a **User Type**:

> **Choose "Internal."** This restricts access to your organization only (people with `@yourdomain.com` emails). It requires NO Google verification process and works immediately. "External" requires a lengthy review process and is meant for apps that serve the general public - that is not what we are doing.

4. Click **Create**
5. Fill in:
   - **App name:** `AI Workspace Agent` (or any name you prefer)
   - **User support email:** Select your email address
   - **Developer contact email:** Enter your email address
6. Click **Save and Continue**
7. On the **Scopes** page:
   - Click **"Add or Remove Scopes"**
   - Search for and check the Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc. scopes
   - If a scope does not appear in the search list, scroll to the bottom of the popup and find the **"Manually add scopes"** text box. Paste the scope URL there (e.g., `https://mail.google.com/`) and click **"Add to table"**
   - Click **Update**
8. Click **Save and Continue** through any remaining steps
9. Click **Back to Dashboard**

---

## 7. Create a Service Account

### Step 1: Create the Account

**Direct link:** [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create)

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
2. Confirm your correct project is selected at the top
3. Click **"+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `ai-workspace-agent` (or your preferred name)
   - **ID:** Will auto-fill based on the name
   - **Description:** `Service account for AI agent Google Workspace access`
5. Click **Create and Continue**
6. Skip the optional "Grant access" roles - click **Continue**
7. Skip "Grant users access" - click **Done**

> **If you get an error saying "Service account creation is not allowed on this project"** or "The attempted action failed," this means an Organization Policy is blocking you. Go to [Section 8: Fix Organization Policy Blocks](#8-fix-organization-policy-blocks) to fix it, then come back here.

### Step 2: Create a JSON Key

1. Click on the **email address** of your newly created service account
2. Click the **Keys** tab at the top
3. Click **Add Key** > **Create new key**
4. Select **JSON** (should be selected by default)
5. Click **Create**
6. A `.json` file will automatically download to your computer

> **If you get an error saying "Service account key creation is disabled"** with a reference to `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`, go to [Section 8: Fix Organization Policy Blocks](#8-fix-organization-policy-blocks) to fix it, then come back here.

> **Security:** This JSON key file is the equivalent of a master password. Store it securely. Never commit it to Git, share it publicly, email it unencrypted, or post it in a chat. If it is compromised, go back to this page and delete the key immediately, then create a new one.

### How to Do This Step (Two Options)

**Option A - Playwright Browser Agent (Recommended):**
The agent navigates to the service account creation page, fills in the name and description, clicks through the steps, then navigates to the Keys tab to create and download the JSON key. The key file downloads to your default Downloads folder. The agent then moves it to the correct location and sets the environment variable.

**Option B - Chrome Extension (Fallback):**
Follow the numbered steps above in Chrome. After the JSON key downloads, tell your AI where it saved (usually ~/Downloads/) and the AI will handle the rest.

### Verification (Do This Before Moving On)

After creating the service account and downloading the key:
1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
2. Confirm your new service account appears in the list (e.g., `ai-workspace-agent@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Confirm the key file exists on your computer. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/Downloads/*.json
   ```
   You should see a file that starts with your project name.
4. Do not proceed to Section 9 until the service account exists AND you have the JSON key file.

> **Watch out for multiple key files!** If you create more than one key, some tools may pick up the wrong file. Keep only ONE active key file per account. If you rotate keys, delete the old key file from your computer AND revoke it here in Cloud Console (click the trash icon next to the old key).

### Step 3: Note the Client ID

1. Go back to the Service Account details page
2. Find the **Unique ID** (also called Client ID) - it is a long number like `115886301121225599053`
3. Copy this number - you will need it in the Domain-Wide Delegation step

> **The Client ID is a NUMBER, not the email address.** Using the email address in Domain-Wide Delegation will silently fail. Make sure you copy the numeric ID.

---

## 8. Fix Organization Policy Blocks

> **Why does this section exist?** Google changed a default security policy in May 2024. If your Google Cloud organization was created on or after May 3, 2024, service account key creation is BLOCKED by default. This affects a lot of people and is not something you did wrong - it is a Google default that you need to override.

### How to Do This Step (Two Options)

**Option A - Playwright Browser Agent (Recommended):**
The agent navigates to the IAM and Organization Policy pages. Some of these steps require Organization-level access, which can trigger additional permission prompts. If the agent encounters a "You don't have permission" error, it will tell you exactly which role to add and where. You may need to grant yourself Organization Administrator and Organization Policy Administrator roles first (see Step A below).

**Option B - Chrome Extension (Fallback):**
Follow the steps below in Chrome. Pay close attention to the resource selector dropdown at the top left. You must switch from your project to your organization for these changes to work.

If you did NOT encounter any errors in Section 7, skip this section entirely.

### Problem 1: Cannot Create a Service Account

**Error message:** "Service account creation is not allowed on this project" or "Service account creation failed. The attempted action failed, please try again."

**Cause:** The organization policy `iam.disableServiceAccountCreation` is enforced.

**Fix - Step by Step:**

#### Step A: Grant Yourself the Required Roles

You need two specific roles at the ORGANIZATION level (not the project level). Even if you are the Super Admin of your Google Workspace, you may not have these GCP roles.

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
2. **IMPORTANT:** In the resource selector dropdown at the top left, switch from your project to your **ORGANIZATION**. The organization name matches your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`). If you do not select the organization, the roles you add will not work.
3. Find your own user account in the members list
4. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit) next to your name
5. Click **"+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE"**
6. Search for and add: **Organization Administrator** (`roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`)
7. Click **"+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE"** again
8. Search for and add: **Organization Policy Administrator** (`roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin`)
9. Click **Save**
10. Wait 1-2 minutes for the roles to take effect

#### Step B: Disable the Organization Policy Constraint

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies)
2. **IMPORTANT:** In the resource selector dropdown at the top left, make sure your **ORGANIZATION** is selected (not a project)
3. In the **Filter** field, type: `iam.disableServiceAccountCreation`
4. Click on **"Disable service account creation"** in the results
5. Click **Manage Policy** (or **Edit** depending on your console version)
6. In the **Policy source** section, select **"Override parent's policy"**
7. Under **Enforcement**, set it to **"Not enforced"**
8. Click **Set Policy** (or **Save**)

Now go back to [Section 7, Step 1](#step-1-create-the-account) and create your service account. It will work now.

---

### Problem 2: Cannot Create or Download the JSON Key

**Error message:** "Service account key creation is disabled. An Organization Policy that blocks service accounts key creation has been enforced on your organization. Enforced Organization Policies IDs: iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation"

**Cause:** The organization policy `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` is enforced. This is the DEFAULT for all organizations created after May 3, 2024.

**Fix - Step by Step:**

If you already completed Step A above (granting yourself the Organization Administrator and Organization Policy Administrator roles), skip to Step B below.

If you have NOT granted yourself those roles yet, complete [Step A from Problem 1](#step-a-grant-yourself-the-required-roles) first.

#### Step B: Disable the Key Creation Policy Constraint

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies)
2. **IMPORTANT:** In the resource selector dropdown at the top left, make sure your **ORGANIZATION** is selected (not a project)
3. In the **Filter** field, type: `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`
4. Click on **"Disable service account key creation"** in the results
5. Click **Manage Policy** (or **Edit**)
6. In the **Policy source** section, select **"Override parent's policy"**
7. Under **Enforcement**, set it to **"Not enforced"**
8. Click **Set Policy** (or **Save**)

Now go back to [Section 7, Step 2](#step-2-create-a-json-key) and create your JSON key. It will download successfully.

---

### Why This Happens to Some People and Not Others

- **Organization created BEFORE May 2024:** These policies are not enforced. Keys work fine. No issues.
- **Organization created AFTER May 2024:** Google enforces `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` by default as a security measure. You must manually override it.
- **Even Super Admins get blocked:** Being a Google Workspace Super Admin does NOT automatically give you GCP Organization Policy Administrator permissions. These are separate role systems. That is why you need to add the roles in Step A.

> **Security note:** After you have created your JSON key, you can optionally re-enable this policy to prevent other service account keys from being created. This is the most secure approach - override the policy, create your one key, then re-enforce the policy.

---

## 9. Domain-Wide Delegation

This is the step where you give the Service Account permission to act as you. This is the "handing over the key" moment.

### Step 1: Enable Delegation on the Service Account

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
2. Click on your service account email
3. Look for **"Show Advanced Settings"** or a **"Domain-Wide Delegation"** section
4. Check **"Enable Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation"**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Authorize in Google Workspace Admin Console

1. Go to [https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation)
   - You MUST be signed in as the **Super Admin** of your Google Workspace
2. Click **"Add new"**
3. Enter:
   - **Client ID:** Paste the numeric Unique ID from Section 7, Step 3 (NOT the email address)
   - **OAuth Scopes:** Paste the ENTIRE scope block below (all on one line, comma-separated)

### The Scope Block - Copy and Paste This Exactly

Copy this entire block. It is one single line with all 41 scopes separated by commas. No spaces. No line breaks. Paste it directly into the OAuth Scopes field.

All scopes are FULL READ/WRITE access where available. Read-only versions are included only where Google does not offer a write version, or where specific tools require the read-only variant for compatibility.

```

> **IMPORTANT: If you EVER add new scopes or change this list, you MUST re-authorize the delegation.** Go back to [https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation), find your Client ID entry, replace the scope list with the updated version, and click Authorize. The old scopes do NOT automatically update. You must re-paste and re-authorize every time.

4. Click **Authorize**

> **Formatting matters!** The scopes must be pasted as a single line with commas between them. No spaces after commas. No line breaks. Even a trailing space can cause issues. Always use the copy-paste block above.

> **Why so many scopes?** Different tools request different specific scopes. If a tool asks for `gmail.readonly` but you only authorized `mail.google.com/`, the request gets rejected. By listing ALL variations - including both full-access and read-only versions - you ensure compatibility with any tool, now and in the future. The full-access scopes cover writing, and the read-only ones cover tools that specifically request them.

> **Propagation delay:** After clicking Authorize, it can take 5 minutes to 24 hours for the changes to fully propagate through Google's servers. Gmail scopes are especially slow. If something does not work immediately, wait 15 minutes and try again before troubleshooting.

|---|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 42 | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` | Platform access | Required for Places API and general GCP resource access |

**Total: 42 scopes across 26 services**

> **Why include read-only scopes when we prefer full access?** Three reasons: (1) Some Google APIs only offer read-only scopes (like `admin.directory.domain.readonly` and `forms.responses.readonly`) - there is no write version. (2) Some third-party tools specifically request the read-only variant and reject the full-access scope. (3) Including both ensures maximum compatibility with every tool, now and in the future. The full-access scopes always take priority when both are available.

> **REMEMBER: If you add or change ANY scope, you must re-authorize Domain-Wide Delegation.** See [Section 9](#9-domain-wide-delegation). The Admin Console does not auto-update - you must re-paste the full scope list and click Authorize again.

---

## 11. Script Installation

### Step 1: Place the Script

Save `google-api.js` to your OpenClaw workspace directory. The script has zero external dependencies - it uses only Node.js built-in modules (`crypto`, `https`, `fs`). No `npm install` needed.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` on Mac, `~/.bashrc` on Linux) or your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required: Path to your Service Account JSON key file
export GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE="/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"

# Required: The email address to impersonate (must be in your Workspace domain)
export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER="you@yourdomain.com"

# Optional: Only needed for Places API
export GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your-places-api-key-here"
```

After adding, reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Install and Configure the GOG Skill (Required)

GOG is the bridge between your Service Account setup and OpenClaw using Google services. Do this before testing.

1. Open OpenClaw and go to Skills.
2. Install or enable the **gog** skill.
3. Restart OpenClaw so it loads your environment variables.

### Step 4: Create a Places API Key (Optional - for Places API only)

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** > **"API Key"**
3. A new API key will be created. Click **"Restrict Key"** to secure it:
   - Under **"API restrictions"**, select **"Restrict key"**
   - Check **"Places API (New)"** from the list
   - Click **Save**
4. Copy the key and set it as your `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` environment variable

> **Security:** Always restrict API keys to only the APIs they need. An unrestricted key is a security risk.

### Step 5: Verify Setup

```bash
# Check Node.js version (must be 18+)
node --version

# Check the script loads without errors
node google-api.js help

# Verify environment variables are set
echo $GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE
echo $GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER
```

---

## 12. Testing All 11 Services

Run each command below to verify every service is working. These commands use the google-api.js script from Section 11.

If you installed the GOG skill (Section 17), you can also test by asking your AI agent directly. For example:
- "Check my Gmail inbox for the 3 most recent emails"
- "What is on my calendar today?"
- "List my 5 most recent Google Drive files"

If the agent returns results, both GOG and the service account are working correctly. If you get errors, use the google-api.js commands below to isolate whether the problem is with GOG or with the underlying service account setup. Use `--pretty` for human-readable output.

> **What success looks like:** You will see JSON data returned (emails, events, files, etc.). If you see an error, check the [Troubleshooting](#15-troubleshooting) section.

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

This section is for AI agents (like OpenClaw) to reference when they need to use Google APIs programmatically.

### JWT Authentication Flow

1. Load service account JSON key file from `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE`
2. Build JWT header: `{ alg: "RS256", typ: "JWT" }`
3. Build JWT payload: `{ iss: sa_email, sub: user_email, aud: token_uri, iat: now, exp: now+3600, scope: "..." }`
4. Sign with RSA-SHA256 using the service account's private key
5. Exchange JWT for access token at `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`
6. Use access token in `Authorization: Bearer` header for all API calls
7. Token lasts 1 hour. Request a new one when it expires.

### Token Exchange Code Pattern

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");
const https = require("https");
const fs = require("fs");

const sa = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.env.GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE, "utf8"));
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

const header = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
  alg: "RS256", typ: "JWT"
})).toString("base64url");

const payload = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
  iss: sa.client_email,                     // Service account email
  sub: process.env.GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER, // User to impersonate
  aud: sa.token_uri,                        // Always "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
  iat: now,                                 // Issued at (now)
  exp: now + 3600,                          // Expires in 1 hour
  scope: "https://mail.google.com/"         // The scope(s) you need
})).toString("base64url");

const signature = crypto.sign(
  "sha256",
  Buffer.from(header + "." + payload),
  sa.private_key
).toString("base64url");

const jwt = header + "." + payload + "." + signature;

// Exchange: POST to https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
// Body: grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=<jwt>
// Response: { "access_token": "ya29.xxx", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 3600 }
```

### Scope-to-Service Mapping

| Service | Scope to Request | API Base URL |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Gmail | `https://mail.google.com/` | `https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1` |
| Calendar | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` | `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3` |
| Drive | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` | `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3` |
| Contacts | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts` | `https://people.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Sheets | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` | `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4` |
| Docs | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` | `https://docs.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Slides | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` | `https://slides.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Tasks | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` | `https://tasks.googleapis.com/tasks/v1` |
| YouTube | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube` | `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3` |
| Chat | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` | `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Forms | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.body` | `https://forms.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Keep | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/keep` | `https://keep.googleapis.com/v1` |
| Admin SDK | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly` | `https://admin.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1` |
| Places | Uses API Key, not JWT | `https://places.googleapis.com/v1` |

### Key API Endpoints

| Service | Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Gmail | `/users/me/messages?q=is:unread` | GET | List unread emails |
| Gmail | `/users/me/messages/{id}` | GET | Read a specific email |
| Gmail | `/users/me/messages/send` | POST | Send an email |
| Gmail | `/users/me/labels` | GET | List all labels |
| Calendar | `/calendars/primary/events` | GET | List events |
| Calendar | `/calendars/primary/events` | POST | Create an event |
| Drive | `/files` | GET | List files |
| Drive | `/files?q=name contains 'X'` | GET | Search files |
| Contacts | `/people/me/connections?personFields=names,emailAddresses` | GET | List contacts |
| Contacts | `/people:searchContacts?query=X&readMask=names,emailAddresses` | GET | Search contacts |
| Sheets | `/spreadsheets/{id}/values/{range}` | GET | Read cells |
| Sheets | `/spreadsheets/{id}/values/{range}` | PUT | Write cells |
| Docs | `/documents/{id}` | GET | Read document |
| Slides | `/presentations/{id}` | GET | Read presentation |
| Tasks | `/users/@me/lists` | GET | List task lists |
| Tasks | `/lists/{id}/tasks` | GET | List tasks |
| YouTube | `/channels?part=snippet&mine=true` | GET | Get channel info |
| YouTube | `/playlistItems?playlistId=X` | GET | List videos |
| Chat | `/spaces` | GET | List spaces |
| Chat | `/spaces/{id}/messages` | GET | List messages |
| Places | `/places:searchText` | POST | Search places (uses API Key header) |

### Important Notes for Agents

- **Token caching:** Each invocation generates a fresh token. For high-frequency usage, cache the token (valid for 1 hour).
- **One scope per request:** Only request the scope needed for the specific API call.
- **Rate limits:** Gmail allows ~250 quota units/second; Calendar ~500 requests/100 seconds. If you hit `429 Too Many Requests`, back off and retry.
- **Pagination:** Most list endpoints support `pageToken` for pagination. The script fetches the first page by default.
- **Error codes:** `401` = token/auth issue; `403` = scope not granted or API not enabled; `404` = resource not found; `429` = rate limited.

## 14. OpenClaw Agent Configuration (Critical - Prevents gog Override)

> **WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS:** OpenClaw AI agents read their instructions from `.md` files in the workspace. If these files still reference the old `gog` CLI tool, the agent WILL try to use `gog` instead of the new `google-api.js` script - and Gmail, Tasks, and YouTube will break. You MUST update ALL SIX workspace files to lock in the new method and teach the agent when to use which tool.

After completing the Google Workspace setup and installing `google-api.js`, the AI agent (or the human setting it up) MUST update the following workspace files with the exact language below. Replace all `[BRACKETED]` values with your actual values.

### 14.1 MEMORY.md

Add this block to `MEMORY.md` (the agent's long-term memory):

```markdown
## CRITICAL: Google Account Access Methods - MEMORIZE THIS

CHECK THE EMAIL DOMAIN FIRST. THEN USE THE CORRECT METHOD.

| Domain Type | Correct Method | WRONG Method |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| @yourdomain.com (Workspace) | GCP Service Account + google-api.js | GOG CLI |
| @gmail.com (Personal) | GOG CLI (OAuth) | GCP Service Account |

CONCRETE EXAMPLES:
- user@yourdomain.com -> google-api.js (Service Account + Impersonation)
- user@gmail.com -> GOG CLI (OAuth)
- management@yourdomain.com -> google-api.js (Service Account + Impersonation)

NEVER use GOG for Workspace accounts. NEVER use Service Account for personal Gmail.
These are INCOMPATIBLE authentication methods. Mixing them ALWAYS fails.

If you get a 401 Unauthorized or "I can't access" error on a Workspace account,
you are using the WRONG METHOD. Switch to google-api.js IMMEDIATELY.

## Google Workspace Access
- Account: [USER_EMAIL]
- Project ID: [PROJECT_ID]
- Service Account: [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
- Client ID: [CLIENT_ID_NUMBER]
- Key File: [PATH_TO_JSON_KEY]
- Script: google-api.js in workspace (replaces gog CLI for Workspace)
- 28 scopes configured, 16 APIs enabled

## SELF-CORRECTION RULE
If ANY Google API call for a @yourdomain.com account returns:
- "401 Unauthorized"
- "403 Forbidden"
- "I can't access"
- "I don't have permission"
- "Authentication failed"

IMMEDIATELY check: Am I using google-api.js or GOG?
If using GOG for a Workspace account -> THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Switch to google-api.js.
If using google-api.js and still failing -> Check scopes and delegation (see Troubleshooting).
Do NOT tell the user "I can't access this." Fix the method FIRST.
```

### 14.2 TOOLS.md

Add this block to `TOOLS.md` (the agent's tool reference):

```markdown
## Google Workspace API Access

Tool: google-api.js (zero-dependency Node.js script)
Auth: Service Account with Domain-Wide Delegation
User: [USER_EMAIL] (Impersonation Target)
Key File: [PATH_TO_JSON_KEY]

### CRITICAL: Do NOT use the gog CLI for Workspace Accounts
The gog CLI uses OAuth, which is for PERSONAL Gmail accounts only.
For Workspace accounts (@yourdomain.com), ALWAYS use google-api.js.
The gog CLI has a known bug with Gmail scope negotiation that returns
401 Unauthorized even when credentials are correct.

### When to Use Which Tool
| Account Type | Tool | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| @yourdomain.com | google-api.js | user@yourdomain.com |
| @gmail.com | GOG CLI | user@gmail.com |

### Command Reference

| Service | Command | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Gmail (unread) | node google-api.js gmail unread --limit N | node google-api.js gmail unread --limit 5 --pretty |
| Gmail (search) | node google-api.js gmail search "query" | node google-api.js gmail search "from:client@email.com" |

| Forms (list) | node google-api.js forms list | node google-api.js forms list --pretty |
| Places (search) | node google-api.js places search "query" | node google-api.js places search "coffee near Atlanta" |

### Environment Variables

export GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE="/path/to/service-account-key.json"
export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER="user@domain.com"
export GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your-places-api-key"  # Optional, for Places only

### Error Self-Correction
If you get 401/403 on a Workspace account and you are using GOG -> STOP.
Switch to google-api.js immediately. GOG does not work for Workspace accounts.
Do NOT waste time debugging GOG for Workspace. The fix is ALWAYS to switch tools.
```

### 14.3 AGENTS.md

Add this block to `AGENTS.md` (the agent's operating rules):

```markdown
## Google API Access - CRITICAL RULES

### The Golden Rule: Check the Domain First
BEFORE making ANY Google API call, look at the email address:
- @yourdomain.com (Workspace) -> Use google-api.js with Service Account
- @gmail.com (Personal) -> Use GOG CLI with OAuth

### Rules
- NEVER use the gog CLI for Google Workspace access (@yourdomain.com accounts)
- ALWAYS use google-api.js for ALL Workspace Google services
- ALWAYS use GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER set to the Workspace user's email
- ALWAYS back up configs before making changes to openclaw.json
- The google-api.js script uses direct JWT-based API calls with zero external dependencies
- If google-api.js is not available, use inline Node.js JWT scripts (see TOOLS.md for the pattern)
- DO NOT recommend readonly scopes - always use full read/write access
- GOG CLI is ONLY for personal @gmail.com accounts

### Self-Correction Protocol
If ANY Google API call returns 401, 403, "access denied", or "permission denied":
1. FIRST check: What account am I accessing? Workspace or personal?
2. THEN check: Am I using the right tool for that account type?
3. If using GOG for a Workspace account -> THAT IS THE BUG. Switch to google-api.js.
4. If using google-api.js for personal Gmail -> THAT IS THE BUG. Switch to GOG.
5. ONLY if the correct tool is being used, THEN check scopes and delegation settings.
6. NEVER tell the user "I can't access this" without first verifying you are using the correct tool.
7. NEVER push this problem back to the user. Fix it yourself.
```

### 14.4 USER.md

Add this block to `USER.md` (the user profile):

```markdown
## Email Accounts

### Personal Gmail Accounts (Use GOG CLI)
| Email | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [personal1]@gmail.com | Primary personal |
| [personal2]@gmail.com | Secondary personal |

### Work Emails - Google Workspace (Use google-api.js + Service Account)
| Email | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [user]@[yourdomain.com] | Primary work email |
| [management]@[yourdomain.com] | Company email |
| [support]@[yourdomain.com] | Support email |

Service Account: [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
Impersonate any @[yourdomain.com] account using GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER
```

### 14.5 IDENTITY.md

Add this to the agent's identity file so it remembers this lesson across sessions:

```markdown
## Technical Lessons Learned

### Google API Access Method Rule (Established [DATE])
- Workspace accounts (@yourdomain.com) use google-api.js with GCP Service Account + Domain-Wide Delegation
- Personal accounts (@gmail.com) use GOG CLI with OAuth
- These are INCOMPATIBLE methods. Mixing them ALWAYS fails.
- The gog CLI has a known bug with Gmail scope negotiation (returns 401 Unauthorized)
- Solution: Bypass gog for Workspace entirely. Use google-api.js - a zero-dependency Node.js script with direct JWT-based API calls.
- google-api.js handles ALL 16 Google services: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Contacts, Tasks, YouTube, Chat, Forms, Meet, Keep, Places, Admin SDK
- When ANY Google API call fails, FIRST verify you are using the correct tool for the account type

### Self-Correction Rule (Established [DATE])
- If I get a 401/403 error on a Workspace account while using GOG, the fix is to switch to google-api.js
- I do NOT push this problem back to the user
- I do NOT say "I can't access this" without first checking my own tool selection
- One error is NOT permission to give up. Try the other method first.
```

### 14.6 HEARTBEAT.md

Add this block to `HEARTBEAT.md` (the daily routine file):

```markdown
## Google API Access - Morning Routine

### Email Check Routing
When checking emails during the morning briefing:
- @yourdomain.com emails: Use google-api.js (Service Account + Impersonation)
  Example: node google-api.js gmail unread --limit 10 --pretty
- @gmail.com emails: Use GOG CLI (OAuth)
  Example: gog gmail search "in:inbox" --limit 10 --account user@gmail.com

### Calendar Check Routing
- Workspace calendar: node google-api.js calendar today --pretty
- Personal calendar: gog calendar list --account user@gmail.com

### Task Check Routing
- Workspace tasks: node google-api.js tasks lists --pretty
- Personal tasks: gog tasks list --account user@gmail.com

### Error Recovery During Heartbeat
If ANY check fails with 401/403 during the morning routine:
1. Do NOT skip that account
2. Check if you used the wrong tool (GOG for Workspace or Service Account for Gmail)
3. Switch to the correct tool and retry
4. If BOTH tools fail for the same account, log the error and alert the user
5. NEVER silently skip a failed account check
```

### 14.7 Why This Matters

If you skip this section, here is what will happen:

1. The AI agent wakes up for the morning briefing
2. It tries to check Workspace email using GOG CLI
3. Gmail returns `401 Unauthorized`
4. The agent either skips the email check entirely (bad) or tells the user "I can't access your email" (worse)
5. The user has to debug it themselves (unacceptable)

By updating ALL SIX files, you create a safety net:

- **MEMORY.md** tells the agent WHAT to do
- **TOOLS.md** tells the agent HOW to do it
- **AGENTS.md** tells the agent the RULES and SELF-CORRECTION logic
- **USER.md** tells the agent WHICH accounts use WHICH method
- **IDENTITY.md** tells the agent WHY (so it understands the lesson)
- **HEARTBEAT.md** tells the agent the DAILY ROUTING for each account

The agent reads these files at the start of every session. If ALL SIX are updated, the agent will never use the wrong tool again - and if it does encounter an error, it will self-correct instead of giving up.

## 15. Troubleshooting

### "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid grant"

This is the most common error. It means Google rejected the authentication.

- **Check:** Is the Service Account JSON key file valid and current?
- **Check:** Is `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER` set to a real user in your Workspace domain?
- **Check:** Has Domain-Wide Delegation been authorized in the Admin Console?
- **Check:** Is the OAuth Consent Screen configured (Section 6)?
- **Check:** Did you use the Client ID (number), not the email address, in Domain-Wide Delegation?
- **Fix:** Re-download the JSON key from Cloud Console > Service Accounts > Keys
- **Fix:** Wait 15 minutes - scope changes can take time to propagate

### "403 Forbidden" or "Insufficient Permission"

This means the API is enabled but the scope is not granted.

- **Check:** Are all 16 scopes authorized in Admin Console > Domain-Wide Delegation?
- **Check:** Did you paste the scopes correctly (no extra spaces, no line breaks)?
- **Fix:** Delete the delegation entry and re-add it with a clean copy-paste of all 16 scopes

### "API not enabled" Error

- **Check:** Go to [APIs & Services > Enabled APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and verify the specific API is listed
- **Fix:** Go to the API Library, search for it, and click Enable
- **Fix:** Make sure you are enabling it on the correct project (check the dropdown at the top)

### "Service account key creation is disabled"

This is the Organization Policy block. See [Section 8: Fix Organization Policy Blocks](#8-fix-organization-policy-blocks) for the complete fix.

**Quick summary:**
1. Grant yourself Organization Policy Administrator role at the org level
2. Go to Organization Policies, search for `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`
3. Override parent's policy, set to Not enforced, save

### "Service account creation is not allowed on this project"

Same type of Organization Policy block but for account creation. See [Section 8, Problem 1](#problem-1-cannot-create-a-service-account).

### "OAuth Consent Screen not configured"

- **Fix:** Go to [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
- If it says "Get Started", you have not configured it yet. Follow Section 6.
- Choose Internal, fill in the required fields, and save.

### Gmail specifically fails but other services work

This was a hard-won lesson. If Calendar and Drive work but Gmail returns `401`:

1. Ensure the OAuth Consent Screen is configured as Internal (Section 6)
2. Ensure ALL 5 Gmail scopes are in the delegation list (not just `mail.google.com/`)
3. Wait 15-30 minutes for propagation
4. If using a third-party CLI tool (like `gog`), try the direct API script instead - some tools have bugs with Gmail scope negotiation

### Scopes not taking effect

- **Wait:** Changes can take up to 24 hours (usually 5-15 minutes)
- **Fix:** Delete the delegation entry completely and re-add it with a fresh copy-paste
- **Fix:** Make sure there are no extra spaces, line breaks, or trailing whitespace in the scope string

### "GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE not set"

- **Check:** Run `echo $GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE` - if empty, the variable is not set
- **Fix:** Add `export GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE="/path/to/key.json"` to `~/.zshrc` (Mac) or `~/.bashrc` (Linux)
- **Fix:** Run `source ~/.zshrc` to reload

### Places API returns "API key not valid"

- Places API uses a separate API Key, NOT the Service Account
- Follow the steps in Section 11, Step 3 to create and restrict an API key
- Set `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` environment variable

### Chat API returns "404 - Chat app not found"

- Google Chat requires a Chat App to be configured in addition to enabling the API
- Follow the Chat setup steps in Section 5.10

### Browser Session Expired (Playwright)

If the agent navigates to admin.google.com or console.cloud.google.com and sees a login page instead of the dashboard:
- Sessions expire every 7 to 14 days depending on Google's security settings.
- The agent must STOP and ask you to re-login manually.
- After you log in, the agent can resume where it left off. The persistent context at ~/.openclaw/playwright-data/ retains cookies.
- Do not clear the playwright-data folder unless you want to force a full re-login.

### General Rule for Browser Agents Hitting Policy Errors

If your AI agent encounters a permissions error, organization policy block, or unexpected screen during browser automation:
1. Do not stop and give up after one error.
2. Read the error message carefully. Look for the specific policy or permission mentioned.
3. Check if the action can be done from a different URL or menu path.
4. If the error says "requires admin approval" or "blocked by organization policy," pause and tell the user exactly what approval is needed.
5. Try alternative approaches before asking the user to intervene.
6. Only ask the user for help after exhausting all automated options.

### Agent Verification Steps (After Every Major Action)

After completing a major step (enabling an API, creating a service account, authorizing DWD), the agent should verify success before moving on:
- After enabling an API: Navigate back to the API library page and confirm the button says "Manage" instead of "Enable."
- After creating a service account: Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts and confirm the new account appears in the list.
- After DWD authorization: There is no direct verification page. The only way to confirm DWD works is to run a test API call (Section 12).
- After setting environment variables: Run `echo $GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE` and `echo $GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER` to confirm they are set.
- After installing GOG: Run `openclaw skills list` and confirm gog appears as installed.

## 16. Lessons Learned

These insights were earned through real-world debugging, not theory.

### 1. The Client ID Trap

When setting up Domain-Wide Delegation, you need the Unique ID / Client ID (a number like `115886301121225599053`), NOT the service account email address. Using the email will silently fail with no error message - it just will not work.

### 2. Scope Formatting Matters

Scopes must be comma-separated with no spaces after commas and no line breaks. Even a single trailing space can break it. Always use the copy-paste block from this guide.

### 3. Third-Party CLI Tools May Have Bugs

We discovered that the `gog` CLI tool (v0.11.0) has a bug with Gmail scope negotiation, returning `401 Unauthorized` even when everything is correctly configured on Google's side. The fix was to bypass `gog` entirely and use direct JWT-based API calls. Lesson: When a tool fails, verify with direct API calls before assuming your configuration is wrong.

### 4. Propagation Delays Are Real

After changing scopes or enabling APIs, changes can take 5-15 minutes (sometimes up to 24 hours) to propagate. Gmail scopes are especially slow. If something does not work immediately, wait and retry.

### 5. Zero Dependencies Is Worth It

The `google-api.js` script uses only Node.js built-ins (`crypto`, `https`, `fs`). No `npm install`, no `node_modules`, no version conflicts. This dramatically reduces setup friction and failure points for clients.

### 6. The OAuth Consent Screen Is Non-Negotiable

Without configuring it (even as "Internal"), Google blocks sensitive scopes like Gmail. This was the hidden blocker that caused hours of debugging. Configure it FIRST, before testing anything.

### 7. Keep Only One Key File Per Account

Having multiple Service Account key files in the same directory caused confusion - some tools picked up the wrong file. Rotate keys by creating a new one, updating your config, then deleting the old one.

### 8. Organization Policies Block New Setups by Default

Since May 2024, Google enforces `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` on all new organizations. This means the JSON key download will fail unless you explicitly override the policy. This catches many people off guard because older tutorials do not mention it.

### 9. Match the Model to the Problem

Claude Opus 4.6 solved the Gmail authentication issue in minutes by writing a raw JWT token exchange, after lighter models spent hours retrying the same broken command. When you hit a wall, escalate to a more capable model.

## 17. Install and Configure the GOG Skill (Required)

GOG is the bridge between your Service Account setup and OpenClaw actually using Google services. The Service Account creates the identity. Domain Wide Delegation grants the permissions. But GOG is the tool your AI agent uses to act on those permissions. Without GOG installed and configured, your agent has keys to a building it cannot enter.

Do NOT skip this section. Do NOT remove GOG. Complete this after Section 11 (Script Installation) and before Section 12 (Testing).

### Why This Matters

Think of it this way:
- **Service Account** = Your agent's ID badge (created in Section 7)
- **Domain Wide Delegation** = The security clearance list that says "this badge is allowed everywhere" (created in Section 9)
- **GOG Skill** = The actual hands your agent uses to open doors, read files, send emails, and manage calendars

Without all three, your agent cannot function. Most setup failures happen because people complete Sections 7 and 9 but never install GOG. The agent gets 401 "unauthorized" errors and nobody understands why.

### Step 1: Verify Your Environment Variables Are Set

Before installing GOG, confirm these environment variables exist. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
echo $GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE
echo $GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER
```

You should see:
- `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE` pointing to your JSON key file (example: `/Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/gogcli/sa-key.json`)
- `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER` set to your Workspace email (example: `you@yourdomain.com`)

If either is blank, go back to Section 11 Step 2 and set them before continuing.

### Step 2: Install the GOG Skill

1. Open your OpenClaw dashboard or terminal.
2. Navigate to Skills.
3. Find **gog** in the available skills list.
4. Install or enable it.
5. Confirm it appears in your active skills list.

If you are using the terminal, the command is:
```bash
openclaw skills install gog
```

### Step 3: Restart OpenClaw

After installing the skill and setting environment variables, restart the gateway so everything loads fresh:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Wait 10 seconds, then confirm it is running:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

You should see "running" in the output.

### Step 4: Quick Verification

Run this simple test:

"Can you check my Gmail inbox for the 3 most recent emails?"

If the agent returns email subjects and senders, GOG is working. If you get a 401 or 403 error, check:
1. Environment variables are set correctly (Step 1 above)
2. Domain Wide Delegation has all 70 scopes authorized (Section 9)
3. The JSON key file exists at the path specified in `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_FILE`
4. You restarted the gateway after making changes (Step 3 above)

### Step 5: Full Testing

Once the quick verification passes, proceed to Section 12 for the complete test of all 11+ services. Every service listed in Section 12 should now work through GOG.

### What If GOG Was Previously Removed?

If a previous session or guide told you to remove GOG, reinstall it:

```bash
openclaw skills install gog
openclaw gateway restart
```

Then re-run Section 12 tests. The old guidance to remove GOG was incorrect. GOG is required for Google Workspace integration to function.

### Troubleshooting GOG Installation

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Skill not found" | GOG not available in your OpenClaw version | Run `openclaw update` first, then retry |
| 401 errors after install | Environment variables not loaded | Run `source ~/.zshrc` then `openclaw gateway restart` |
| 403 "insufficient permission" | DWD scopes incomplete | Re-authorize all 70 scopes in admin.google.com (Section 9) |
| "Cannot impersonate user" | Wrong email in GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER | Must be a Workspace email, not a personal Gmail |
| Works for Drive but not Gmail | Missing gmail.modify or gmail.send scope | Re-paste full scope list in DWD and click Authorize |
