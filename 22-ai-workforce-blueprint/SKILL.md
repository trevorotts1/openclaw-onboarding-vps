# AI Workforce Blueprint Skill

## What This Is

This skill builds the folder and file system that turns your AI agent into a trained workforce.

Without this system, your AI forgets between sessions, gives inconsistent results, and you spend all day repeating yourself. With this system, your AI knows which department owns every task, which role handles it, and exactly which file tells it how to do the work.

**This is completely separate from the Coaching Personas Matrix.** Personas govern HOW an agent thinks and communicates. This blueprint governs WHERE the agent works and WHAT it does. They work together but neither requires the other.

## What It Creates

When you run this skill, your AI builds:

```
[your-workspace]/
  sales-dept/
    [role-folder]/
      00-START-HERE.md
      01-[how-to-file].md
      02-[how-to-file].md
      good-examples.md
      bad-examples.md
      tools.md
  marketing-dept/
    [role-folder]/
      ...
  ops-dept/
  finance-dept/
  coaching-dept/
  leadership-dept/
  universal-sops/
    00-ROUTING.md
    tools.md
```

## When to Trigger This Skill

- User wants to set up their AI company structure
- User says "build my departments" or "scaffold my workspace"
- User is starting a new business or reorganizing an existing one
- User wants their AI to stop forgetting and start operating consistently

## How to Use

**Option A - Automated (recommended):**
Tell your AI: "Build my AI workforce structure. Use the blueprint."
The AI runs `scripts/build-workforce.py` which walks you through questions and creates everything.

**Option B - Manual:**
Read `ai-workforce-blueprint-full.md` and follow the step-by-step instructions to build your own structure.

**Option C - Resume:**
If you already started a structure, tell your AI: "Resume my AI workforce build."
The AI audits your existing folders and fills gaps.
