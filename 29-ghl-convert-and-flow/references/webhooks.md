## Overview

GoHighLevel webhooks deliver real-time event notifications to your endpoint when actions occur inside a location (sub-account). You configure webhooks at the location level. The system sends an HTTP POST to your URL with a JSON payload describing the event.

---

## Webhook Configuration (via GHL UI)

Webhooks in GHL v2 are managed through the GHL UI, not the API directly:

1. Log in to your GHL account (Convert and Flow dashboard)
2. Go to: **Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**
3. Click **Add Webhook**
4. Enter your endpoint URL (must be HTTPS and publicly accessible)
5. Select which event types to subscribe to
6. Save - GHL will send a test ping to verify the endpoint is reachable

## Webhook Payload Structure

Every webhook POST contains a JSON body. The exact fields vary by event type but share this common envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "ContactCreate",
  "locationId": "abc123LocationId",
  "id": "abc123RecordId",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // event-specific fields
  }
}
```

### Example: Contact Create Payload

```json
{
  "type": "ContactCreate",
  "locationId": "abc123LocationId",
  "id": "contactIdHere",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "+15555551234",
  "tags": ["lead", "webinar"],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Example: Inbound Message Payload

```json
{
  "type": "InboundMessage",
  "locationId": "abc123LocationId",
  "conversationId": "convIdHere",
  "contactId": "contactIdHere",
  "messageType": "SMS",
  "body": "Hey, I have a question",
  "direction": "inbound",
  "dateAdded": "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z"
}
```

### Example: Opportunity Stage Update Payload

```json
{
  "type": "OpportunityStageUpdate",
  "locationId": "abc123LocationId",
  "id": "opportunityIdHere",
  "name": "Lead from Website",
  "pipelineId": "pipelineIdHere",
  "pipelineStageId": "stageIdHere",
  "status": "open",
  "monetaryValue": 1500,
  "contactId": "contactIdHere"
}
```

## Webhook Security

- GHL does NOT currently sign webhook payloads with a secret (unlike Stripe/Twilio).
- Validate the `locationId` in the payload matches your expected location.
- Optionally whitelist GHL IP ranges if you need additional security.
- Return HTTP 200 quickly - GHL will retry if your endpoint times out.

---

## Retry Behavior

- GHL retries failed webhook deliveries (non-200 responses) multiple times with exponential backoff.
- Your endpoint should respond with HTTP 200 within 10 seconds.
- For long-running tasks, respond 200 immediately and process async.

## Common Webhook Errors

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No events arriving | Endpoint not HTTPS or not publicly reachable | Use ngrok for local dev, public URL for prod |
| Events arrive but parsing fails | Payload structure mismatch | Log raw body and inspect `type` field first |
| Duplicate events | GHL retried after your endpoint was slow | Idempotency key: use `id` + `type` + `timestamp` combo |
| Wrong location events | Multiple locations sending to same endpoint | Filter by `locationId` in your handler |
