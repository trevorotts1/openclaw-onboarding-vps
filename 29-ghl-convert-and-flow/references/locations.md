## Notes on Agency vs Location Tokens

| Endpoint | Token Needed |
|----------|-------------|
| Create/update/delete sub-account | Agency Token |
| Read location details | Private Integration Token (location-scoped) |
| Custom fields, tags, templates | Private Integration Token |
| SaaS bulk operations | Agency Token |

If you only have a location-level Private Integration Token, you can read and manage the location but cannot create or delete sub-accounts.
