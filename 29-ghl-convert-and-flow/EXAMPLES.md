  echo "ERROR: GHL_API_KEY and GHL_LOCATION_ID must be set."
  echo "Add them to ~/clawd/secrets/.env or export them in your shell."
  exit 1
fi

# Make the call and capture HTTP status code separately
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /tmp/ghl_response.json -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GHL_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Version: 2021-04-15' \
  "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/locations/$GHL_LOCATION_ID")

if [ "$HTTP_CODE" = "200" ]; then

elif [ "$HTTP_CODE" = "401" ]; then
  echo "ERROR 401: Invalid or expired token. Check GHL_API_KEY."
elif [ "$HTTP_CODE" = "403" ]; then
