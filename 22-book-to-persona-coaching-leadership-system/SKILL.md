description: >
  Converts any bestselling book PDF into a dual-purpose persona blueprint — one that coaches
  humans through personal and professional challenges AND governs AI agents executing professional
  work across departments. Runs a 3-phase pipeline: Kimi K2.5 extracts, DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale
  analyzes, GPT-5.3 Codex synthesizes. Output is QMD-indexed for retrieval. Uses the
  Teach Yourself Protocol before every run.

## What This Skill Does

Takes any book (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, or Kindle) and produces a **dual-purpose persona blueprint** through a 3-phase sub-agent pipeline:

- **Phase 1 - Extraction** (Kimi K2.5): Reads the full book text, extracts 20 structured items across two lenses - coaching methodology and agent governance frameworks
- **Phase 2 - Analysis** (DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale): Deep analytical work across 12 dimensions including Amateur-to-Expert Gap, failure taxonomy, execution standards, decision logic
- **Phase 3 - Synthesis** (GPT-5.3 Codex via OAuth): Writes the complete 14-section persona blueprint - fully deployable for both human coaching and AI agent governance

Every persona supports:
1. **Coaching Mode** - activates when a human needs guidance through a challenge
2. **Task Mode** - activates when an AI agent needs a methodology standard for professional work

## Teach Yourself Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before running this skill for the first time, or after any update:

1. Read `SKILL.md` (this file) - overview and how it works
2. Read `INSTALL.md` - dependencies, setup, storage detection
3. Read `PIPELINE.md` - full 3-phase pipeline technical reference
4. Read `CORE_UPDATES.md` - what gets added to which core files
5. Read `QMD-RETRIEVAL-GUIDE.md` - how agents query personas at runtime
6. Read `GOOD-AND-BAD-EXAMPLES.md` - correct vs. incorrect persona builds
7. Read `CHECKLIST.md` - phase-by-phase build checklist

**Do not run the pipeline until all 7 files have been read in this session.**
Confirm by saying: "TYP complete - ready to run Book Intelligence Pipeline."

## When To Use This Skill

- You have a new book PDF to add to the persona library
- You want to rebuild an existing persona with updated extraction
- You are setting up the pipeline for the first time on a new workspace
- You need to add QMD indexing to an existing persona blueprint

## Quick Start (After TYP)

```
Run Book Intelligence Pipeline on: [book title or PDF path]
```

The skill will:
1. Locate or create the master files folder
2. Extract text from the PDF
3. Spawn Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 sub-agents in sequence
4. Save extraction notes, analysis notes, and persona blueprint
5. Index the persona in QMD
6. Update CORE_UPDATES references in core .md files

## Connection to AI Workforce Blueprint (Skill 22)

These two skills are separate but work together automatically.

**If skill 22 (ai-workforce-blueprint) is installed:**
- The workforce scaffold script detects the `coaching-personas` QMD collection during build
- Each department folder gets a `governing-personas.md` showing which personas govern it
- Each `00-START-HERE.md` includes a Governing Personas section with QMD query
- Agents know: go to the right department, use the right persona

**If skill 22 is NOT installed:**
- Personas operate standalone - no department structure required
- Same persona blueprints, same QMD search, just without dept folder wiring

**Cross-reference path:** `~/.openclaw/skills/23-ai-workforce-blueprint/PERSONA-ROUTER.md`
