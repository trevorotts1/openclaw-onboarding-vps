name: book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system
description: >
  Converts any bestselling book PDF into a dual-purpose persona blueprint — one that coaches
  humans through personal and professional challenges AND governs AI agents executing professional
  work across departments. Runs a 3-phase pipeline: Kimi K2.5 extracts, DeepSeek V3.2 analyzes,
  GPT-5.4 Codex synthesizes. Output is Gemini Engine-indexed for retrieval. Wiki-enabled for
  unified knowledge access. Uses the Teach Yourself Protocol before every run.
---

> **Wiki Note:** This skill is integrated with the OpenClaw Memory Wiki system. All persona blueprints are searchable via `wiki_search` and `wiki_get` for unified knowledge retrieval alongside other memory sources.

## What This Skill Does

Takes any book (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, or Kindle) and produces a **dual-purpose persona blueprint** through a 3-phase sub-agent pipeline:

- **Phase 1 - Extraction** (Kimi K2.5): Reads the full book text, extracts 20 structured items across two lenses - coaching methodology and agent governance frameworks
- **Phase 2 - Analysis** (DeepSeek V3.2): Deep analytical work across 12 dimensions including Amateur-to-Expert Gap, failure taxonomy, execution standards, decision logic
- **Phase 3 - Synthesis** (GPT-5.4 Codex via OAuth): Writes the complete 14-section persona blueprint - fully deployable for both human coaching and AI agent governance

Every persona supports:
1. **Coaching Mode** - activates when a human needs guidance through a challenge
2. **Task Mode** - activates when an AI agent needs a methodology standard for professional work

---

## Teach Yourself Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before running this skill for the first time, or after any update:

1. Read `SKILL.md` (this file) - overview and how it works
2. Read `PIPELINE.md` - the full 3-phase pipeline architecture
3. Read `CHECKLIST.md` - the 14-section persona blueprint checklist
4. Read `GOOD-AND-BAD-EXAMPLES.md` - quality standards for persona output
5. Read `PERSONA-ROUTER.md` - task-type to persona routing map
6. Read `GEMINI-RETRIEVAL-GUIDE.md` - how agents query personas at runtime
7. Read `CORE_UPDATES.md` - what to add to your workspace files
8. Read `INSTALL.md` - setup and dependencies

**Do not run the pipeline until all 8 files have been read in this session.**
Confirm by saying: "TYP complete - ready to run Book Intelligence Pipeline."

---

## When To Use This Skill

- You have a new book PDF, EPUB, MOBI, or AZW3 to add to the persona library
- You have a YouTube link (talk, podcast, lecture, interview) that contains the same kind of teaching as a book
- You have a local video file (seminar recording, course session, keynote)
- You have already-transcribed text from any of the above
- You want to rebuild an existing persona with updated extraction
- You are setting up the pipeline for the first time on a new workspace

---

## Quick Start (After TYP) — v9.6.4+

**Single entry point: `add-persona-from-source.sh`** — routes any of the source types above to the right extractor and then through the standard 3-phase pipeline.

```bash
# Book PDF/EPUB/MOBI:
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system/scripts/add-persona-from-source.sh \
    --source "/path/to/Atomic Habits - James Clear.pdf"

# YouTube video (uses Skill 16 — Summarize YouTube — for transcript):
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system/scripts/add-persona-from-source.sh \
    --source "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123" \
    --title "Hormozi Million Dollar Offers Talk" \
    --author "Alex Hormozi"

# Local video file (uses ffmpeg + whisper for transcript):
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system/scripts/add-persona-from-source.sh \
    --source "/path/to/seminar.mp4" --title "Seth Godin Keynote" --author "Seth Godin"

# Already-transcribed text:
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system/scripts/add-persona-from-source.sh \
    --source "/path/to/transcript.txt" --title "Foo" --author "Bar"
```

The script will:
1. Detect source type (book / YouTube / video / text)
2. Extract text via the right tool:
   - Books → pdfplumber
   - YouTube → Skill 16 (Summarize YouTube) for transcript
   - Local video → ffmpeg + Whisper for transcript
3. Drop the text into the persona library and register a `source.json` marker
4. Invoke Skill 22's 3-phase pipeline (Extraction → Analysis → Synthesis)
5. Re-index Gemini Engine so the new persona is immediately searchable
6. Add a stub entry to `persona-categories.json` (you tag manually after first use)

**Dependencies for non-book sources:**
- YouTube: Skill 16 (Summarize YouTube) installed; `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `~/.openclaw/secrets/.env`
- Video: `ffmpeg` + `whisper` (or `whisper-cli`). Mac: `brew install ffmpeg && pip install openai-whisper`. Linux: `apt install ffmpeg && pip install openai-whisper`.

## Model Routing

**All model selection runs through `shared-utils/select_model.py` which enforces Ollama-Cloud-first priority. The selector picks whatever the client has installed, walking down the chain only when a higher tier is unavailable. See `PIPELINE.md` for the full per-phase chain.**

**Explicit priority for Phase 1 + Phase 2 (book extraction + analysis):**

| Tier | Model | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Tier 1 (Primary)** | `ollama/deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` (or latest `ollama/deepseek-v*-pro:cloud`) | Ollama Cloud DeepSeek V4-pro — 1M context, subscription-billed, smartest for long-context analysis |
| **Tier 2 (Primary)** | `ollama/kimi-k2.6:cloud` (or latest `ollama/kimi-k*:cloud`) | Ollama Cloud Kimi 2.6 — 262K context, subscription-billed, smartest for compact extraction |
| **Tier 3 (Fallback)** | `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (or latest `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v*-pro`) | Same DeepSeek V4-pro model via OpenRouter when Ollama Cloud is unavailable. Per-token billed. |
| **Tier 4 (Fallback)** | `openrouter/moonshot/kimi-k2.6` (or latest `openrouter/moonshot/kimi-k*`) | Same Kimi 2.6 model via OpenRouter when Ollama Cloud is unavailable. Per-token billed. |
| **Tier 5 (Last resort)** | `codex/gpt-*` or `openai-codex/gpt-*` (OAuth GPT) | Subscription-billed (ChatGPT plan), used only when both Ollama Cloud AND OpenRouter Kimi/DeepSeek are missing |

**Per-phase tier preference:**

| Phase | Tier preference (in order) |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Phase 1 - Extraction | Tier 1 (Ollama DeepSeek V4-pro) → Tier 2 (Ollama Kimi 2.6) → Tier 3 (OpenRouter DeepSeek V4-pro) → Tier 4 (OpenRouter Kimi 2.6) → Tier 5 (OAuth GPT) |
| Phase 2 - Analysis | Tier 1 (Ollama DeepSeek V4-pro) → Tier 2 (Ollama Kimi 2.6) → Tier 3 (OpenRouter DeepSeek V4-pro) → Tier 4 (OpenRouter Kimi 2.6) → Tier 5 (OAuth GPT) |
| Phase 3 - Synthesis | Tier 5 (OAuth GPT — no per-call cost) → Tier 2 (Ollama Kimi 2.6) → Tier 4 (OpenRouter Kimi 2.6) |

**ABSOLUTE RULES (enforced by the selector):**
- Ollama Cloud is ALWAYS preferred over OpenRouter when both are available. Same model, cheaper route. The selector matches on model family (DeepSeek V*-pro, Kimi K*) and prefers the Ollama-routed copy first.
- If the client has Ollama Cloud DeepSeek V4-pro AND OpenRouter DeepSeek V4-pro, the selector picks Ollama. Same with Kimi 2.6.
- Anthropic models (`anthropic/claude-*`) are FORBIDDEN by policy. Hardcoded filter at every tier.
- The selector reads the client's actual `openclaw.json` and picks the highest available version at each tier. New Kimi/DeepSeek versions are picked up automatically when the client adds them — no code change needed.

## Connection to AI Workforce Blueprint (Skill 23)

**WARNING: Skill 23 requires Skill 22 to be FULLY installed first.**

Skill 23 checks for the `coaching-personas` Gemini Engine collection before running. If not found, it stops with:
> "Install Skill 22 (Book-to-Persona) first"

These two skills are separate but work together automatically.

**If skill 23 (ai-workforce-blueprint) is installed:**
- The workforce scaffold script detects the `coaching-personas` Gemini Engine collection during build
- Each department folder gets a `governing-personas.md` showing which personas govern it
- Each role folder gets its own `governing-personas.md` for role-specific tasks
- Each `00-START-HERE.md` includes a Governing Personas section with Gemini Engine query
- Agents know: go to the right department, use the right persona

**If skill 23 is NOT installed:**
- Personas operate standalone - no department structure required
- Same persona blueprints, same Gemini Engine search, just without dept folder wiring

**Categorization:**
Every persona is auto-tagged in `persona-categories.json` after generation:
- 12 domain tags (Marketing, Sales, Leadership, Finance, etc.)
- 6 perspective tags (African American experience, Women's challenges, etc.)
- Business stage and ideal user metadata
This file is the bridge: Skill 23 reads it to build department-specific persona pools.
