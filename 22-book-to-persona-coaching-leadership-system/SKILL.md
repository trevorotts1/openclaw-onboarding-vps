## What This Skill Does

Takes any book (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, or Kindle) and produces a **dual-purpose persona blueprint** through a 3-phase sub-agent pipeline:

- **Phase 1 - Extraction** (Kimi K2.5): Reads the full book text, extracts 20 structured items across two lenses - coaching methodology and agent governance frameworks
- **Phase 2 - Analysis** (DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale): Deep analytical work across 12 dimensions including Amateur-to-Expert Gap, failure taxonomy, execution standards, decision logic
- **Phase 3 - Synthesis** (GPT-5.3 Codex via OAuth): Writes the complete 14-section persona blueprint - fully deployable for both human coaching and AI agent governance

Every persona supports:
1. **Coaching Mode** - activates when a human needs guidance through a challenge
2. **Task Mode** - activates when an AI agent needs a methodology standard for professional work

## Connection to AI Workforce Blueprint (Skill 23)

**⚠️ DEPENDENCY WARNING: Skill 23 requires Skill 22 to be FULLY installed first.**

Skill 23 checks for the `coaching-personas` Gemini collection before running. If not found, it stops with:
> "Install Skill 22 (Book-to-Persona) first"

These two skills are separate but work together automatically.

**If skill 23 (ai-workforce-blueprint) is installed:**
- The workforce scaffold script detects the `coaching-personas` Gemini collection during build
- Each department folder gets a `governing-personas.md` showing which personas govern it
- Each role folder gets its own `governing-personas.md` for role-specific tasks
- Each `00-START-HERE.md` includes a Governing Personas section with Gemini Engine query
- Agents know: go to the right department, use the right persona

**If skill 23 is NOT installed:**
- Personas operate standalone - no department structure required
- Same persona blueprints, same Gemini search, just without dept folder wiring
