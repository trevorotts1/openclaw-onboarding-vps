## Pre-Processing: PDF Text Extraction

**Tool:** pdfplumber (Python library)
**Cost:** Zero - runs locally, no API calls
**Time:** 5-200 seconds per book depending on size
**Output:** Plain .txt file saved to `[master-files]/coaching-personas/text/`

```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
    text = ""
    for page in pdf.pages:
        t = page.extract_text()
        if t:
            text += t + "\n"
```

Run all books in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor for maximum speed.

## Phase 1 - Extraction (Kimi K2.5)

**Model:** moonshot/kimi-k2.5
**Route:** Moonshot direct API (MOONSHOT_API_KEY)
**Context:** 262K tokens
**Max output:** 96K tokens
**Prompt:** agent-prompts/extraction-agent-prompt.md

**What it extracts (20 items):**
- Coaching lens (items 1-11): Author background, central problem, root cause, full methodology,
  principles, transformation arc, coaching questions, tools/exercises, objection handling,
  author voice, direct quotes
- Governance lens (items 12-20): Execution system, quality bar, non-negotiable rules,
  failure patterns, decision logic, self-review protocol, definition of done,
  amateur-to-expert gap, professional application

**Input to sub-agent:**
- Full content of extraction-agent-prompt.md (system instructions)
- Full book text (up to 200,000 characters)

**Output:** extraction-notes.md saved to persona folder

**Large book handling:**
- Books over 200,000 characters: pass first 200,000 chars (covers most books)
- Kimi's 262K context window safely handles this with room for the system prompt

---

## Phase 2 - Analysis (DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale)

**Model:** deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-speciale
**Route:** OpenRouter
**Context:** 163K tokens
**Prompt:** agent-prompts/analysis-agent-prompt.md

**What it analyzes (12 dimensions):**
1. True operating system (mechanism behind the methodology)
2. Root cause architecture (chain from symptom to root)
3. Amateur-to-Expert Gap (most critical - minimum 5 dimensions)
4. Failure pattern taxonomy (categorized by type)
5. Execution standard (pre-work, during, checkpoints, rules, definition of done)
6. Decision logic framework (minimum 8 decision rules)
7. Coaching framework architecture (3 phases with questions)
8. Voice and language architecture (10 overused words, 10 never-used words)
9. Scope and boundary analysis (where methodology ends)
10. Department and role application map
11. Routing intelligence (15 keyword triggers, scoring logic)
12. The single most important non-obvious insight

**Input to sub-agent:**
- Full content of analysis-agent-prompt.md
- Full extraction-notes.md content

**Chunking (for large extraction notes over 120K chars):**
- Split into overlapping chunks (3K char overlap)
- Analyze each chunk separately
- Final synthesis pass merges chunk analyses

**Output:** analysis-notes.md saved to persona folder

## Phase 3 - Synthesis (GPT-5.3 Codex + Fallback)

**PRIMARY Model:** openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
**Route:** OpenClaw OAuth (ChatGPT subscription - NOT OpenRouter, NOT API key)
**Context:** 400K tokens
**Max output:** 128K tokens
**Prompt:** agent-prompts/synthesis-agent-prompt.md

**FALLBACK Model:** moonshot/kimi-k2.5
**Fallback trigger:** Any of these:
- API error or rate limit (429)
- Timeout after 15 minutes
- Output under 5,000 characters (truncated)
- Any error message in the response

**What it synthesizes (14 sections):**
1. Author Intelligence
2. Core Methodology
3. Coaching Framework (3 phases: Assessment → Challenge → Support)
4. Agent Governance Framework (4A: Execution Standard, 4B: QC Protocol, 4C: Failure Patterns, 4D: Task Activation Language)
5. Foundational Principles
6. Problem-Solution Map
7. Trigger Detection System (Coaching Mode + Task Mode)
8. Voice and Language
9. Quote Library
10. Question Library
11. Tools, Exercises, and Execution Frameworks
12. Objections, Resistance, and Failure Modes
13. Session and Task Structure
14. Routing Rules and Scope Limits

**Input to sub-agent:**
- Full content of synthesis-agent-prompt.md
- extraction-notes.md content (up to 60K chars)
- analysis-notes.md content (up to 60K chars)
- SKILL.md blueprint specification (up to 30K chars)

**Output:** persona-blueprint.md saved to persona folder with header block

---

## Phase 4 - QMD Indexing

After Phase 3 completes for a book:

```bash
# If collection doesn't exist yet
qmd collection add [master-files]/coaching-personas/personas \
  --name coaching-personas \
  --mask "**/*.md"

# Update index with new blueprint
qmd update

# Generate vector embeddings
qmd embed
```

---

## Parallelism Rules

- Maximum 7 books active simultaneously across all phases
- Books flow independently - no batch waiting
- As soon as Phase 1 completes → Phase 2 starts for that book immediately
- As soon as Phase 2 completes → Phase 3 starts for that book immediately
- Status tracked in pipeline-status.json after every phase

---

## Status File Format

```json
{
  "folder-name": {
    "title": "Book Title",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "phase1": "PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | FAILED",
    "phase2": "PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | FAILED",
    "phase3": "PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | FAILED",
    "phase3_model_used": "gpt-5.3-codex | kimi-k2.5 (fallback)",
    "qmd_indexed": true,
    "started": "March 7 at 3:30 PM",
    "completed": "March 7 at 3:52 PM",
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

## Time Estimates (7 parallel, continuous pipeline)

| Phase | Per Book | 7 Parallel Batch | Total (21 books) |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Text extraction | 5-200 sec | ~3 min | ~3 min (all parallel) |
| Phase 1 Kimi | 3-8 min | ~8 min | ~25 min |
| Phase 2 DeepSeek | 2-5 min | ~5 min | ~18 min |
| Phase 3 Codex | 5-12 min | ~12 min | ~40 min |
| QMD indexing | 1-2 min | ~2 min | ~5 min |
| **Total** | | | **~1.5 hours** |

With full 21 simultaneous: ~35-45 minutes total.
