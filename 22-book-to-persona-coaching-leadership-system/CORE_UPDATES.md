**Exact text to add:**
```
## Book-to-Persona Skill (Installed)
Converts any book (PDF/EPUB/MOBI/AZW3) into a dual-purpose persona blueprint.
40 pre-built personas already included. Pipeline runs on new books only.

Pipeline:
- Phase 1: Kimi K2.5 via direct Moonshot API (api.moonshot.ai/v1, temp 1.0) → extraction-notes.md
- Phase 2: DeepSeek V3.2 via OpenRouter → analysis-notes.md
- Phase 3: OpenAI Codex → persona-blueprint.md (all 14 sections)
- Content filter fallback: OpenRouter moonshotai/kimi-k2.5

Persona Reflex (DEFAULT BEHAVIOR):
Before any professional task, run: qmd search coaching-personas "<task keywords>"
Load returned persona's Task Mode. Execute the task through that methodology.
Skip only if Trevor explicitly says so.

Key paths:

## TOOLS.md

**Where:** Add a new section under model routing titled `## Book-to-Persona - Model Routing and QMD`

**Exact text to add:**
```
## Book-to-Persona - Model Routing and QMD
Pipeline model routing:
- Phase 1: moonshot/kimi-k2.5 — MOONSHOT_API_KEY in ~/clawd/secrets/.env — endpoint: https://api.moonshot.ai/v1 — temperature MUST be 1.0
- Phase 2: deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 via OpenRouter ONLY (OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
- Phase 3: openai/gpt-5.2-codex via direct OpenAI API
- Fallback (content filter): OpenRouter moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 for flagged books

QMD collection: coaching-personas
Setup commands (run once on fresh install):
  qmd collection add ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona/personas --name coaching-personas --mask "**/*.md"
  qmd update
  qmd embed  (takes 3-8 min first time, downloads local model, runs offline after)

Runtime query: qmd search coaching-personas "<task keywords>"
After adding new book: qmd update (no need to re-embed everything)
If stale/broken: qmd cleanup && qmd update && qmd embed

Full pipeline reference: ~/.openclaw/skills/22-book-to-persona/PIPELINE.md

## Persona Coaching Voice Rule (Added [DATE])
When operating through a persona from the book-to-persona library:
- NEVER use the author's name in the coaching voice
- The author's name appears ONLY inside attribution-flagged direct quotes
- Coaching Mode speaks in the methodology's voice, not the author's identity
- Example: Do not say "As Mel Robbins says..." - say "The 5-second countdown works because..."
```

## What NOT to Add to Core Files
- Do NOT paste PIPELINE.md into AGENTS.md
- Do NOT paste prompt templates into TOOLS.md
- Do NOT paste the 14-section blueprint format into any core file
- Do NOT add API keys to core files
- Core files get: what it is, what it does, where to find details. That is all.

## AGENTS.md - Pending Skill Setup Rule

**Where:** Add at the bottom of AGENTS.md

**Exact text to add:**
```
## Pending Skill Setup - Check and Remind
File: ~/.openclaw/skills/.pending-setup.md
If this file exists with entries marked Status: PENDING, proactively remind the user.
When relevant to what they are working on, say: "You have a pending skill setup for [key] - want to add that now?"
When user provides the key: save it to ~/clawd/secrets/.env and mark the entry Status: COMPLETE.
Never nag - bring it up once per session max, only when relevant.
```
