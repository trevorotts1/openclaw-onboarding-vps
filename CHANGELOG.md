## v8.1.0 - April 13, 2026 - Platform Architecture Playbook v1.0

### Overview
Release adds the missing platform version-detection architecture so client Sunday update checks can reliably detect and apply a new onboarding release.

### Fixed
- **install.sh version detection**: Moved the repo version sync check to run after `ONBOARDING_DIR` is defined so `set -u` does not hit an unbound variable before the installer can compare versions
- **Release bookkeeping**: Added the missing changelog entry for the v8.1.0 platform architecture release

### Added
- **VERSION-ARCHITECTURE.md**: Documents publisher-side vs client-side version truth, `.onboarding-version`, `.skill-manifest.json`, and rollback behavior
- **scripts/generate-manifest.sh**: Standalone generator for `~/.openclaw/skills/.skill-manifest.json`
- **install.sh manifest generation**: Installer now writes `.skill-manifest.json` after install

### Changed
- **install.sh**: Keeps `ONBOARDING_VERSION` aligned with the repo `version` file and verifies the installed `.onboarding-version` at the end of install
- **scripts/update-skills.sh**: Rewritten as a full safe updater with staged download, version comparison, per-skill diffing, changelog display, risk assessment, backup, confirmation gate, apply, manifest regeneration, logging, Telegram notification, and UPDATE PENDING flag handling
- **Version**: Root `version` and `install.sh` `ONBOARDING_VERSION` bumped to `v8.1.0`

---

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.26
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.26

---

## v6.5.25 - April 3, 2026

### Fixed
- **Skill 23 - Mac backport parity**: Backported VPS v2.1.0 functionality to Mac. Added `--non-interactive` flag and `build_from_config()` for automated `departments.json` generation in Skill 23.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.25
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.25

---

## v6.5.24 - April 3, 2026

### Added
- **Skill 22 - Phase 5 auto-reindex**: Added Phase 5 auto-reindex after persona generation in orchestrator.py so the Gemini persona index is refreshed automatically after synthesis.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.24
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.24

---

## v6.5.23 - April 3, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - Agent message visibility**: Fixed bug where Telegram confirmation told users to "send your agent the message shown in your terminal" but the terminal never printed the exact message. Added clearly formatted "📋 SEND THIS MESSAGE TO YOUR AGENT" block to terminal output. Updated Telegram confirmation message to include the actual text instead of referencing the terminal.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.23
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.23

---

## v6.5.22 - April 1, 2026

### Added
- **QC.md - Skill-specific checklists**: Added comprehensive QC.md files for all 34 skills with skill-specific criteria. Each QC.md includes:
  - Purpose statement tailored to the skill
  - Installation checks (folder existence, SKILL.md, INSTALL.md)
  - Dependency checks (specific packages, CLIs, API keys per skill)
  - Smart key detection with name variations (e.g., OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_KEY)
  - 3-5 functional tests specific to what each skill does
  - QC scoring framework with 8.5/10 minimum passing score
  - QC loop rule (max 5 retry attempts)
- **QC.md - Mac/VPS parity**: Ensured QC.md files are synchronized between Mac and VPS repositories with platform-specific path adjustments

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.22
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.22

---

## v6.5.21 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - Smart skill discovery**: Fixed critical bug where installer counted skills from `skills/` subdirectory (only 3 .skill packages) instead of root (34 numbered skill folders). Added `discover_skills()` function that searches multiple locations (numbered folders, SKILL.md files, installed skills) and returns the highest count. Replaced hardcoded `ls | grep | wc -l` with smart discovery. Added diagnostic output showing skills source/destination paths at start and final count at end.
- **install.sh - Telegram notification**: Removed "Reply YES when ready to proceed." from client-facing Telegram message. This was developer scaffolding that should not appear in production notifications.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.21
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.21

---

## v6.5.20 - April 1, 2026

### Added
- **install.sh - Post-install skill summary**: Added terminal output showing every skill installed/updated with name, description from SKILL.md, and QC rating (PASS/FAIL)
- **install.sh - Untouched skills list**: Shows skills that were left unchanged (already at latest version)
- **install.sh - OpenRouter model check**: Automatically fetches new free models from OpenRouter API and adds them to client's models map. Never touches primary model, never removes existing models.
- **install.sh - Telegram summary**: Sends concise install summary to client's Telegram after completion

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.20
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.20

---

## v6.5.19 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **markitdown-skill**: Added missing SKILL.md and INSTALL.md files to the empty markitdown-skill folder. This was blocking client installs with "empty source folder" error.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.19
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.19

---

## v6.5.18 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - backup_config_file() protocol compliance**: Fixed backup_config_file() to save backups to ~/Downloads/openclaw-backups/ with .txt extension per AGENTS.md protocol. Previously backed up to same directory as original with .bak-timestamp extension.
- **install.sh - Skill count reporting**: Fixed misleading Telegram progress message that reported skills extracted to "OpenClaw" (ambiguous) instead of specifying the actual path `~/.openclaw/onboarding/`. Added Step 3a to copy .skill packages from the skills/ subdirectory to `~/.openclaw/skills/` so the agent finds skills in the expected location. Prevents "only 3 skills found" confusion caused by empty skills directory.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.18
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.18

---

## v6.5.17 - April 1, 2026

### Added
- **install.sh - UPDATE_PENDING flag mechanism**: Added `write_update_pending_flag()` function that writes an UPDATE_PENDING section to AGENTS.md at the end of every install/update. This ensures the agent detects and processes updates on next boot.
- **install.sh - Exact agent message restored**: Terminal and Telegram messages now show the exact message: "You have just received an OpenClaw update. Read the UPDATE_PENDING section in your AGENTS.md, process it, confirm you are ready, then remove the UPDATE_PENDING section from your AGENTS.md."

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.17
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.17

---

## v6.5.16 - April 1, 2026

### Added
- **install.sh - Mandatory backup-before-edit protocol**: Added `backup_config_file()` function that creates timestamped backups before any openclaw.json or exec-approvals.json edit
- **install.sh - Docs verification comments**: Added schema verification comments to all config write blocks referencing docs.openclaw.ai
- **install.sh - Backup calls**: Added backup_config_file calls before all config file modifications

### Fixed
- **install.sh - Exec security unconditional application**: Added `apply_exec_security_config()` function that runs at the end of every installer execution (both fresh install AND update). Previously, exec security config was only inside Step 3c which could be skipped if openclaw.json didn't exist yet. Now exec security is applied unconditionally after all skill installs.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.16
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.16

---

## v6.5.15 - April 1, 2026

### Changed
- **install.sh - Exec security comments**: Updated doc-reference comments for tools.exec and exec-approvals.json sections to cite https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/exec-approvals as the source of truth
- **install.sh - Re-verify note**: Added explicit comment reminding to re-verify exec security config if OpenClaw version is bumped
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.15
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.15

---

## v6.5.13 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - send_telegram_progress function**: Replaced the broken function that had no `--target` or `--channel` flags. The old version silently failed on every fresh install because there was no active Telegram session and no recipient specified. The new version reads the client's Telegram chat ID from `openclaw.json` allowFrom list via python3, passes it explicitly via `--target` and `--channel telegram`, and falls back to terminal output if the ID can't be found or the send fails.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.13
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.13

---

## v6.5.12 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - Gateway restart instruction**: Replaced the Done section with a clear two-step restart flow. Terminal output now shows STEP 1 (restart the gateway) and STEP 2 (send the onboarding message after restart). Without a restart, the agent won't see the ONBOARDING PENDING flag for up to 30 minutes.
- **install.sh - Telegram timing**: Moved send_telegram_progress call to BEFORE the terminal output block so the notification fires before the script completes. Updated the Telegram message to include restart instructions (`/restart`) and the exact message to send after restart. Previously the Telegram fired silently and the client was never told to restart.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.12
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.12

---

## v6.5.11 - April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- **install.sh - Primary model protection**: Sub-agent model config now checks for existing `agents.defaults.subagents.model.primary` before writing. If the client already has a primary model set, it is preserved exactly. Only sets the default (`openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`) on fresh installs. Prevents overwriting client-customized model choices on re-runs.
- **install.sh - ONBOARDING_FLAG heredoc**: Added critical wave ordering rule: Skill 12 (openrouter-setup) MUST be installed first in Wave 1 before any other skill. Other skills spawn sub-agents that need OpenRouter configured first. Skipping or delaying Skill 12 causes cascading sub-agent failures.
- **install.sh - ONBOARDING_FLAG heredoc**: Added MiMo V2 Pro thinking level rule. Main agent uses medium (default). All sub-agents spawned via sessions_spawn() must explicitly pass `thinking: "high"`. Never rely on default thinking for sub-agents.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.11
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.11 (was v6.5.6, out of sync)

---

## v6.5.10 - April 1, 2026

### Added
- Skill 31 (Upgraded Memory System): Added QC.md with quality control checks (mirrored from VPS v6.5.12)
- Skill 32 (Command Center Setup): Added QC.md with quality control checks (mirrored from VPS v6.5.12)


## v6.5.9 - April 1, 2026

### Changed
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Removed openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small-creative (deprecated, end-of-life April 30, 2026)
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated all routing guidance to use MiniMax M2.7 for writing/creative tasks
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Removed all Mistral references from INSTALL.md, openrouter-setup-full.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, EXAMPLES.md, QC.md

## v6.5.8 - April 1, 2026

### Changed
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Removed openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2-codex, openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini, openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano from all config blocks, model lists, narrative references, and routing tables
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated all routing guidance to use MiniMax M2.7 / MiMo V2 Pro / DeepSeek R1 Free as replacements
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Fixed fallback order -- kimi-k2.5 now appears before nemotron in fallback chain

## v6.5.7 - April 1, 2026

### Changed
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Removed all Anthropic model entries (claude-opus-4.6, claude-sonnet-4.6, claude-haiku-4.5)
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Removed all Perplexity model entries (sonar-pro-search, sonar)
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Added openrouter/openrouter/free model
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated fallback chain order -- MiMo V2 Pro first, Gemini Flash Lite second, OpenRouter Free third, then remaining models
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated primary model recommendation to openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-pro for sub-agents
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated all config JSON examples and bash blocks to reflect new model roster (19 models)
- Skill 12 (OpenRouter Setup): Updated INSTALL.md, openrouter-setup-full.md, EXAMPLES.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, QC.md

# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenClaw Onboarding package are documented here.

---

## v6.5.6 — April 1, 2026

### Added
- Per-skill version tracking: each skill folder now contains `skill-version.txt`
- update-skills.sh now compares per-skill versions before overwriting — prevents false "up to date" reports when a skill folder exists but is at an older version

### Fixed
- install.sh ONBOARDING_VERSION header updated from v6.1.9 to match actual repo version (v6.5.6)
- check-update-impact.sh and setup-weekly-update.sh version headers synced to v6.5.6

---

## v6.5.5 — April 1, 2026

### Fixed
- Skill 22 folder name references updated from `22-book-to-persona/` to `22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system/` in all scripts and docs — prevents "directory not found" errors on fresh installs

---

## v6.5.4 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **Version file sync**: Updated version file from v6.5.2 to v6.5.4 to match HEAD commit (0243586d). Version file was not bumped in v6.5.3 or v6.5.4 commits.

---
## v6.5.0 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **Runtime persona wiring (AGENTS.md)**: Added Persona Operating Protocol to ~/clawd/AGENTS.md. Every department agent now reads governing-personas.md at task start and operates through that persona for the entire task. Applies to all 17 departments via symlinks.
- **Skill 23 INSTALL.md Phase 5-BUILD-B**: Added instruction to append Persona Operating Protocol to each department's AGENTS.md during setup.
- **Skill 32 INSTALL.md Phase 7.4**: Added Persona Runtime Test to verification phase. Agents must answer "What persona are you operating as and why?" with a reference to governing-personas.md. Fail = install incomplete.

## v6.5.1 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed (QC-driven, 8→10 round)
- **Skill 22**: Added gemini-search.py and gemini-indexer.py to pipeline/ directory within the skill folder. Fresh client installs no longer fail at Step 5b (QC: 8→10).
- **Skill 23**: Documented canonical departments.json path as ~/Downloads/openclaw-master-files/company-discovery/departments.json in both INSTALL.md and CORE_UPDATES.md. Absolute path, not relative (QC: 8→9.5).
- **Skill 23**: Graceful Skill 22 dependency -- Skill 23 no longer blocks if Skill 22 is not installed. Persona creation falls back to local files.
- **Skill 32**: Added 10 Telegram progress pings to INSTALL.md covering every long-running command (npm install, PM2, cloudflared tunnel, database seeding). Added 5-minute npm install timeout with retry fallback (QC: 8→9.5).
- **Skill 32 seed-workspaces.py**: Added canonical departments.json path as first search candidate. Handoff from Skill 23 to Skill 32 now airtight.

## v6.5.2 — March 31, 2026

### Added
- **Dynamic Persona Selection Engine**: Every agent now runs Gemini search + 5-layer alignment scoring before selecting a persona for a new task. No more static "always use Primary" behavior.
- **AGENTS.md**: Persona Operating Protocol now has 3 new steps: (1) Gemini Search finds top 3 candidates, (2) 5-Layer Alignment picks the winner, (3) Reason Log entry to daily memory/[date].md. Graceful fallback to governing-personas.md Primary if Gemini unavailable.
- **Skill 23 Phase 5-BUILD-B**: Dynamic persona selection engine with weighted scoring table (Owner Values 25%, Company Mission 25%, Business KPIs 20%, Dept KPIs 15%, Task Fit 15%).
- **Skill 32 Phase 7.5**: 3-layer runtime verification test — Search Evidence (did agent use Gemini?), 5-Layer Alignment (can agent explain reasoning?), Reason Log (did agent write to daily memory file?). FAIL conditions catch agents that always default to the same persona.
- **Phase numbering fix**: Renumbered duplicate Phase 7.4 in Skill 32 to 7.4/7.5/7.6.

## v6.5.3 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed (adversarial QC-driven fixes)
- **gemini-search.py**: Now returns parent folder names (e.g., "rackham-spin-selling") not bare filenames. Deduplicates by folder -- returns 3 DISTINCT personas not 3 chunks from same file. Clean error on empty input. Exit code 2 on missing API key (triggers AGENTS.md fallback).
- **gemini-indexer.py**: Exit code 2 (not sys.exit(1)) on missing API key for --status. Added --watch flag for auto-reindex on new book drop. Added --rotate-logs flag with 100-entry cap and archive rotation.
- **install.sh**: Scripts now copy to ~/clawd/scripts/ (correct path). Added gemini-search.py to copy (was missing). Removed hardcoded Cloudflare tunnel token (was exposed in public GitHub repo).
- **7 governing-personas.md**: Legal→Tawwab, WebDev→Clear, IT→Samit, Video→Kane, Audio→Grenny, Creative→Godin, AppDev→Clear. Daniel Miller: 5 depts → 1. Jim Collins: 3 depts → 1.
- **AGENTS.md**: Added weighted scoring rubric for 5-layer alignment (Owner Values 3x, Mission 2x, Biz KPIs 2x, Dept KPIs 1.5x, Task Fit 1x). Tie-breaking rule documented.
- **AGENTS.md + MEMORY.md**: Added permanent QC Execution Rule -- QC must run scripts not read docs. Any QC on a script requires 3 mandatory execution tests (valid input, empty input, missing API key).

---

## v6.4.0 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **Skill 22 INSTALL.md**: Added Step 5b to deploy gemini-search.py and gemini-indexer.py to ~/clawd/scripts/ after indexing. Added graceful degradation when GOOGLE_API_KEY is missing (falls back to PERSONA-ROUTER.md, no sys.exit).
- **Skill 22 CORE_UPDATES.md**: Added mandatory re-indexing trigger to AGENTS.md section. When a new persona is added, agents must run gemini-indexer.py.
- **Skill 23 INSTALL.md**: Phase 5-PERSONA now requires explicit content in every governing-personas.md with gate check (grep verification). Phase 6 now has mandatory specialist folder creation (2+ role files per dept) and ORG-CHART.md creation, both with gate checks.
- **Skill 23 CORE_UPDATES.md**: Added Governing Personas Update Protocol to AGENTS.md section -- re-index, review assignments, update ORG-CHART.md when new books added.

---

## v6.3.0 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **Skill 23 Phase 0a**: Replaced hard exit if Skill 22 missing with graceful degradation. Workforce build now proceeds with generic personas; client notified they can add custom personas later via Option C.
- **Skill 23 naming convention**: Removed all -dept suffix references from INSTALL.md (10 edits), CORE_UPDATES.md (1 edit). Standardized to no-suffix folder names matching build-workforce.py actual output.
- **Skill 32 INSTALL.md**: Removed -dept suffix from department folder references. Consistent with Skill 23.
- **Interview answer canonical path**: Canonicalized to ~/Downloads/openclaw-master-files/company-discovery/ across INSTALL.md and CORE_UPDATES.md (Skill 23). Removed 3 wrong path references.
- **Phase 5-PRE check path**: Fixed from ~/.openclaw/workspace/ to ~/clawd/departments/ in Skill 23 INSTALL.md.

---

## v6.2.0 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **Command Center (Skill 32) integration with Skill 23**: seed-workspaces.py now scans ~/clawd/departments/ where Skill 23 writes departments. Strips -dept suffix from folder names. DB path corrected to ~/projects/command-center/.
- **Hardcoded "17 departments" removed**: INSTALL.md Phase 6.5 now uses dynamic count placeholder instead of hardcoded number.
- **Agent ID format unified**: Changed from cc/[name] to dept-[name] throughout INSTALL.md to match Skill 23 format. Updated Phase 4.2, 5.4, 7.2.
- **install.sh progress visibility**: Removed -s silent flag from curl. Added show_status() messages with time estimates before long operations. Added send_telegram_progress() notifications at 6 key steps.
- **Removed __pycache__** from version control, added .gitignore.

---

## v6.1.9 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **update-skills.sh Telegram message**: No longer tells user to relay a message to the agent. Now simply says "restart your gateway, your agent will handle the rest." The agent auto-detects the UPDATE PENDING flag on boot.
- **update-skills.sh Terminal output**: Same fix. Agent auto-detects. No user message relay needed.

---

## v6.1.8 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **update-skills.sh message**: Replaced vague "Review the update reports" with specific instruction pointing to /tmp/oc-update-notification.md and UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md. Agent now knows exactly where to find update details and what to do with them.

---

## v6.1.7 — March 31, 2026

### Fixed
- **update-skills.sh Terminal output**: Always shows gateway restart command and agent message, regardless of Telegram send status. Previously only showed when Telegram failed.
- **update-skills.sh Telegram message**: Now includes "openclaw gateway restart" as Step 1 before the agent instruction. Previously did not tell users to restart.
- **update-skills.sh Telegram errors**: Now logs the actual Telegram API response and config status instead of silently hiding errors.

### Added
- **setup-weekly-update.sh**: Saturday 11:59 PM cron job — runs `npm update -g openclaw` to update OpenClaw CLI before Sunday onboarding check. Ensures config structures are validated against the latest OpenClaw version.
- **install.sh**: Sub-agent default model — sets `agents.defaults.subagents.model.primary` to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` so sub-agents use a cheaper model by default.
- **HEARTBEAT.md model check**: Step 1 now checks `openclaw --version` and validates config structures against the current OpenClaw version before making changes.

### Removed
- **Perplexity models from allow list**: OpenClaw no longer supports Perplexity as a model. Any `openrouter/perplexity/*` entries in the client's model allow list are now automatically removed during install and updates.

### Changed
- **install.sh**: Sync ALL client models to sub-agent allow list — scans entire openclaw.json for model references and adds them to agents.defaults.models. Sub-agents can use any model the client has configured, not just the 8 hardcoded core models.
- **UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md Step 6**: Exhaustive credential search — now checks 10+ env file locations, 4 openclaw.json sections, system env, and shell variables before marking a credential as BLOCKED. Explicit warning: "Do NOT ask the client until you have searched ALL locations."
- **UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md Step 4e**: Fixed maxChildrenPerAgent mismatch — was 10, corrected to 20 (consistent with install.sh and Step 4c).

### Added
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Sunday 3 AM agent update check — agent reads changelog, sends Telegram summary, waits for approval, follows UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: OpenClaw model check — verifies client has latest models, researches docs.openclaw.ai and OpenClaw GitHub before any model changes
- **HEARTBEAT.md**: Post-update QC loop — QC all updated skills, spin up sub-agent to fix failures, re-QC, maximum 5 retries per skill
- **setup-weekly-update.sh**: Gateway restart after update staging — agent picks up UPDATE PENDING flag on boot instead of waiting for manual restart
- **setup-weekly-update.sh**: Smart restart — only restarts gateway if an update was actually staged (checks for flag file)

---

## [v6.1.6] - March 29, 2026

### Interview Persistence Protocol + Update Flow Fixes + Terminology
- **Skill 5 CORE_UPDATES.md**: Added GHL/PIT terminology. AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md sections now explain that GHL uses Private Integration Tokens, not API keys.
- **Skill 23 SKILL.md**: Added explicit "I Don't Know" Research Protocol. When client cannot answer, agent researches best practices tailored to their industry, goals, department, and role. Presents recommendation, waits for approval, logs with attribution.

#### Added
- **TERMINOLOGY.md**: New repo-root file defining GHL/Convert and Flow/GoHighLevel naming rules and Private Integration Token (PIT) terminology. Required reading for all agents.
- **Skill 23 SKILL.md**: Full Interview Persistence Protocol replacing one-line flush note. 4-step mandatory flush after every question (answer to disk first, handoff update, MEMORY.md progress, then next question). Boot-time resume logic with 4-tier fallback. Edge cases: skip/circle-back, answer corrections, stale handoffs (90+ days), crash recovery, resume triggers.
- **Skill 23 CORE_UPDATES.md**: Interview Resume Protocol section for AGENTS.md — boot-time check for incomplete interviews.

#### Changed
- **scripts/update-skills.sh**: v6.1.3. Now sends Telegram notification directly to paired user using botToken and allowFrom from openclaw.json. If Telegram fails, prints clear fallback box in Terminal with exact agent instruction. AGENTS.md flag still written as backup layer.
- **install.sh**: Auto-cleanup of misplaced config keys. If `subagents` or `allow` appear under top-level `models` (where they do not belong), they are deleted automatically. Prevents config validation errors on startup.
- **UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md**: v6.1.3. Added explicit JSON paths for subagent config (`agents.defaults.subagents`) and model allow list (`agents.defaults.models`). Added TERMINOLOGY.md reference. Warns agents not to put subagents under `models`.
- **Start Here.md**: Added TERMINOLOGY.md reference.
- **All script headers**: Synced to 6.1.3.

#### Removed
- **Perplexity sonar models** from model allow list (install.sh, deprecated-models.json, UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md). `openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro-search` and `openrouter/perplexity/sonar` are web search tools, not models. Allow list is now 8 models.

#### Fixed
- Script version headers were out of sync with repo version file. All 3 scripts now match `version` file. New rule: every push must bump version + headers in same commit.
- UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md told agents to add subagent config but did not specify the JSON path, causing agents to put keys in the wrong place (`models` instead of `agents.defaults`).

---

## [v6.1.0] - March 27, 2026 (Late Evening)

### Skill 23 Persistence Hardening + Version-Proof Update System + Notification Overhaul

#### Added
- **scripts/setup-weekly-update.sh**: v4.0 rewritten. Installs a Sunday 3:00 AM cron job that uses the GitHub-hosted curl command to stage updates. Version-proof: always pulls the latest updater from GitHub, never a stale local file.
- **Skill 23 templates/company-discovery/workforce-interview-answers.md**: Default interview answer template for guaranteed persistence.
- **Skill 23 templates/company-discovery/interview-handoff.md**: Resume state template for long-running interviews.

#### Changed
- **Skill 23 build-workforce.py**: Persistence hardened. `find_master_files_folder()` now guarantees a valid path and never returns None. If the normal path doesn't exist, it falls back to `~/clawd/data/company-discovery/` with explicit warning. `log_answer()` and `create_handoff()` now print success/error to stderr. No code path where an answer is silently dropped.
- **UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md**: Overhauled to v2.0. Added STEP 16: Client Notification Protocol with 3-channel fallback (Telegram → email → SMS). Added 4 message templates (Update Found, Update Applied, Update Blocked, SMS Fallback). Added plain-English guidance on what "staged" means. Added fallback channel protocol with email subject lines and SMS templates. Method 1 updated to use GitHub-hosted curl bootstrap command.
- **scripts/update-skills.sh**: v4.0 rewritten. Now generates a client-friendly notification message at /tmp/oc-update-notification.md instead of just saying "update staged." The notification explains what was found, what it means, what will happen if they say yes, and what they need to do. AGENTS.md flag now points agent to the notification file.
- **Version file**: v6.0.7 -> v6.1.0

## [v6.0.7] - March 27, 2026

### Persona Matching Protocol + Skill 32 Token-in-Webhook Architecture

#### Added
- **persona-matching-protocol.md** (Skill 23): New reference document defining the 5-layer persona alignment check (Company Mission, Owner Values, Company Goals/KPIs, Department Goals/KPIs, Task Fit). Layers 1-2 run once at setup to create a pre-qualified pool. Layers 3-5 run fresh for every task. Personas are matched per-task at runtime, not statically assigned per department.
- **persona-categories.json** (Skill 22): 40 personas tagged with 12 domain categories (marketing, sales, leadership, finance, operations, communication, copywriting, mindset, productivity-systems, coaching, strategy-innovation, personal-development) and 6 perspective tags (african-american-experience, womens-challenges, mens-challenges, family-relationships, faith-spirituality, love-romantic-relationships). Category-filtered matching enables efficient search across large persona libraries.

#### Changed
- **Skill 23 INSTALL.md**: Persona alignment section rewritten. governing-personas.md is now a REFERENCE GUIDE in each role folder, not a static department assignment. Added 5-layer alignment description and runtime matching instructions.
- **Skill 23 SKILL.md**: Corrected persona-matching-protocol.md reference from "3-layer" to "5-layer" (matches the protocol document and all other references).
- **Skill 32 INSTALL.md Phase 6b**: Architecture rewritten. Tunnel token now returned directly in the webhook HTTP response (JSON: tunnelToken, subdomain, tunnelId). Agent captures token programmatically, saves to ~/.openclaw/.env, starts PM2, verifies URL. Trevor still receives a backup Telegram notification with the same token. No more manual token forwarding step.
- **Skill 32 INSTALL.md Phase 6b**: cloudflared installation now built into the process. Step 6b.2 installs cloudflared via brew (Mac) or curl (Linux) before the webhook call.
- **32-command-center-setup/scripts/create-tunnel.sh**: Complete rewrite. Reduced from 147 lines to 59. Removed Cloudflare API calls, credential file management, launchctl plist generation, local tunnel config. Added auto cloudflared install, webhook POST with token capture, PM2 process management, clean verification.

#### Removed
- **Skill 32**: Manual "Wait for Trevor's Token" step (6b.3). Token now comes in webhook response.
- **Skill 32**: Manual echo CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN step. Replaced with automated grep/mv in script.
- **Skill 32 create-tunnel.sh**: All Cloudflare API code (account ID, bearer token, tunnel creation via API, credential file writing, config-command-center.yml generation, launchctl plist creation). Replaced by single webhook call.

## [v6.0.2] - March 25, 2026

### Update System Fix

#### Fixed
- **scripts/update-skills.sh**: Complete rewrite. Now stages updates to /tmp and creates .update-pending flag file. No longer attempts to apply changes directly — agent follows UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md.
- **Version comparison bug**: Eliminated. Script now reads version files directly instead of parsing changelog headers.
- **scripts/deprecated-models.json**: New file. Single source of truth for required models, deprecated model replacements, and sub-agent configuration.
- **UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md**: Step 4d now references deprecated-models.json. Step 4e added for sub-agent config check (maxSpawnDepth: 4, maxChildrenPerAgent: 10, maxConcurrent: 20).

#### Added
- MiMo V2 Pro (openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-pro) to required model list
- MiMo V2 Omni (openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-omni) to required model list
- Sub-agent config validation (4, 10, 20)
- .update-pending flag file mechanism (replaces AGENTS.md bloat)

#### Changed
- update-skills.sh no longer applies changes — it stages the update and the agent follows UPDATE-PLAYBOOK.md
- Deprecated minimax-m2.5 → minimax-m2.7 tracked in deprecated-models.json

## [v6.0.1] - March 22, 2026

### Bug Fixes - Install Sequence, Skill 15, Skill 22, Gemini Engine

#### Fixed
- **install.sh**: Gemini Engine script no longer runs indexer on empty directories. Step 3b now only copies script + installs python package. Indexing deferred to after Skill 22 adds books.
- **install.sh**: Step 3b API key search now checks ~/.openclaw/.env first (OpenClaw standard) instead of hardcoded ~/clawd/secrets/.env (Trevor-specific path).
- **install.sh**: Step 3c now also sets model allow list (9 models) alongside sub-agent concurrency settings.
- **install.sh**: Step 4 now creates ~/Downloads/openclaw-master-files/ folder (coaching-personas/personas + project-prds).
- **Start Here.md**: Added Step 2.5 (sub-agent concurrency + model allow list) between backup protocol and Step 3.
- **Start Here.md**: Removed stale Skill 13 dependency. Skill 14 now runs independently.
- **Start Here.md**: Removed Skill 13 from Agent C assignment and Wave 2 install loop.
- **Skill 15**: Hard-coded team Telegram IDs (Trevor: 5252140759, LeAnne: 6663821679, E.R. Spaulding: 6771245262) back into INSTALL.md and TEAM_CONFIG.md. Previous sub-agent replaced them with placeholders.
- **Skill 15**: Removed interactive Step 0 intake questions. Step 0 now loads pre-configured data from TEAM_CONFIG.md.
- **Skill 15**: Step 2 now verifies existing sub-agent settings instead of overwriting them.
- **Skill 22**: Added model fallback chain. Primary: Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter, then MiMo V2 Pro, then Kimi via Moonshot, then GPT Codex, then Gemini/Sonnet.
- **Skill 22**: INSTALL.md Step 4 now checks which models are available instead of requiring Moonshot API key.
- **gemini-indexer.py**: Added --status, --init, --dry-run flags. Skips missing collections gracefully. Supports multiple collections.

## [v6.0.0] - March 22, 2026

- No automatic changes are applied without user approval

#### Total Skills: 31 (Skill 13 archived)

---

## [v4.0.1] - March 16, 2026

### Skill Restructure — Voice Call Plugin Removed, Fish Audio Renumbered

#### Changed
- **Skill 30 (Voice Call Plugin) REMOVED** — The `@openclaw/voice-call` plugin is an official OpenClaw npm package installed via `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/voice-call`. Having it as an onboarding skill caused double-install conflicts on machines where it was already installed. Clients install it manually after onboarding.
- **Skill 31 → Skill 30 (Fish Audio API Reference)** — Renumbered. Now the final skill. Standalone reference doc so the agent knows Fish Audio endpoints, parameters, and call patterns.
- **Old Skill 30 folder archived** as `30-blackceo-voice-call-plugin-ARCHIVED`
- **README and Start Here updated** to reflect new skill numbering

---

## [v4.0.0] - March 16, 2026

### Major Release — Department Restructure, Interdepartmental Communication, Persona Mapping, Surgical Updates

#### Skill Restructure
- **Removed Skill 30** (Voice Call Plugin) — voice-call plugin is installed via OpenClaw npm (`openclaw plugins install @openclaw/voice-call`), not via onboarding. Having it in onboarding caused double-install conflicts.
- **Renamed Skill 31 → Skill 30** — Fish Audio API Reference is now Skill 30 (standalone reference doc)
- **Total skills: 30** (was 31)

#### New Departments
- **graphics-dept** — NEW separate department for all static image/visual work (KIE.ai primary, Nano Banana, OpenAI images, FAL optional)
- **video-dept** — NEW separate department for all video production (KIE.ai video endpoints, ties to Skills 24-28)
- **audio-dept** — NEW separate department for the full audio lifecycle: generate, transcribe, process, deliver (KIE.ai audio/ElevenLabs/Suno endpoints, Fish Audio, Whisper local/cloud)
- **creative-dept restructured** — now ALL written content only ("If it starts as words, it starts here"). Covers copywriting, blog posts, speeches, keynotes, presentation scripts, PowerPoint content, podcast scripts, video scripts. Creative writes — other departments produce.

#### Suggested Roles Per Department
- Added `23-ai-workforce-blueprint/suggested-roles/` folder with 15 department files
- Each file includes: role names, what each role does, core SOPs to build, persona trait suggestions, interdepartmental relationships
- CRM Specialist role documented across multiple departments (sales, marketing, creative, billing, graphics, video, audio) with department-specific SOPs for each

#### Department Folder Organization
- All department folders now live inside `openclaw-master-files/my AI company departments/`
- Company discovery subfolder: `company-discovery/workforce-interview-answers.md` and `persona-alignment-notes.md`
- Daily company logs: `daily-company-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with Gemini Engine integration

#### Interdepartmental Communication System
- Added `universal-sops/cross-dept-request-template.md` — standard format for all cross-dept requests
- Added `universal-sops/interdepartmental-communication-guidelines.md` — CC model (not approval model), direct dept-to-dept communication with master orchestrator awareness
- Added `03-Activity-Log-Template.md` — running daily log format for the master orchestrator
- Pre-built cross-dept workflow SOPs for common routes (Sales→Audio, Marketing→Graphics, Video→Audio, etc.)

#### Persona 4-Layer Alignment Protocol
- Added `universal-sops/persona-re-evaluation-protocol.md`
- 4 layers: Company Alignment → Owner/CEO Alignment → Role/Functional Alignment → Beliefs/Principles Alignment
- Both Layer 3 (what they DO) and Layer 4 (WHY they do it) must pass
- Re-evaluation triggers: company goals change, new dept added, owner priorities shift, role changes, persona underperforming

#### Weekly Auto-Update System (Rebuilt)
- `scripts/update-skills.sh` rebuilt with surgical logic: changelog-first, version comparison, gap analysis, impact rating
- `scripts/check-update-impact.sh` — helper for per-file risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- `scripts/setup-weekly-update.sh` updated to v2.0
- Impact levels: LOW (auto-apply), MEDIUM (recommend + confirm), HIGH (recommend SKIP + show diff)
- NEVER overwrites: core .md files, company dept folders, custom SOPs
- NEVER triggers gateway restart — always instructs client with restart steps

#### AI Workforce Interview Improvements
- Context-first questioning: agent checks existing files before asking any question
- Cross-department learning: answers carry forward, reducing questions as interview progresses
- Running answers document: `company-discovery/workforce-interview-answers.md` (append-only)

#### Daily Company Log System
- Master orchestrator appends log entries in real time (not end of day)
- Concise single-line timestamped format: `HH:MM — Dept→Dept: action [JobID] ✅/🔄`
- Gemini Engine integration: previous day's log embedded every morning
- Annual archive: end of year move to `archive/YYYY/`, Gemini Engine embed archive

---

## [v3.0.0] - March 15, 2026

### Major Release — Voice System, Skill Quality, Model Fixes

#### Added
- **Skill 31: Fish Audio API Reference** — standalone Fish Audio skill for podcast, video narration, speeches, webinars, and all non-phone audio generation
- **Fish Audio S2 Voice Behavior SOP v3.0** — added to both Skill 30 (Voice Call) and Skill 31 (Fish Audio). Large TYP deep-reference document covering 8 parts: tag system, universal rules, phone call SOP, podcast SOP, AI decision logic, voice selection, master instruction blocks, and quick-reference cheat sheet. Do NOT load into core files — TYP required
- **CHANGELOG.md and README.md** — now present in both repos

#### Fixed
- **Skill count updated throughout**: all references to "29 skills" updated to "31 skills" (install.sh, AGENTS.md, Start Here.md, ONBOARDING PENDING flag)
- **OpenRouter model ID bugs**: `hunter-alpha` and `healer-alpha` now correctly use `openrouter/` prefix. Was causing "not a valid model ID" errors for all clients
- **NVIDIA Nemotron model ID**: fixed to include `:free` suffix — `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`
- **ONBOARDING PENDING flag message**: corrected "29 skills" → "31 skills" in install.sh output
- **Skill quality improvements**: skills 03, 14, 21, 25, 27 all raised from below 8.5 to 8.5+ after targeted fixes

#### Changed
- **Version bump**: v2.4.0 → v3.0.0 (major release due to voice system additions)
- All 31 skills now score 8.5 or above on the 5-dimension evaluation rubric (Clarity, Completeness, Intent Preservation, Error Recovery, Size/Complexity)

---

## [v2.2.2] - March 12, 2026

### Added
- **SKILL INSTALLATION PROTOCOL** section in Start Here.md: mandatory 5-step protocol that agents must follow for every skill (01-29). Addresses agent shortcut-taking, incomplete TYP execution, and premature "done" declarations.
- **ZERO TOLERANCE SHORTCUTS** language explicitly forbids: "I'll read that later", "This looks similar", "I can skip this step", "Close enough", "The user probably wants".
- **Step-by-step verification requirements**: agents must list every .md file read, confirm step completion, and verify all success criteria before declaring a skill complete.
- **Anti-drift safeguards**: no global "done" until all 29 skills verified, no skipping "optional" skills, explicit checkpoint before ONBOARDING COMPLETE status.
- **GATEWAY RESTART PROTOCOL**: agents are forbidden from triggering gateway restarts autonomously. Must notify user and ask for explicit permission before any restart.
- **COMPLETE ALL DEPENDENCIES**: agents must complete every dependency, sub-task, and configuration step listed in skill docs. No partial installs.
- **OPENROUTER RULE**: agents are forbidden from changing user's primary model when installing OpenRouter. Install tooling only, inform user, offer help if asked.
- **MAIN ORCHESTRATOR ONLY SKILLS**: 22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system and 23-ai-workforce-blueprint must be installed by main orchestrator only, never sub-agents.
- **GOOGLE WORKSPACE - SAVE FOR LAST**: Google Workspace skills (13/14) must be installed after all other skills due to complexity and user interaction requirements.
- **ONBOARDING FLOW PROTECTION**: For AI Workforce Blueprint, agent must notify user first and wait for explicit response before asking configuration questions.
- **MASTER FILES FOLDER DISCIPLINE**: Agent must check for existing master files folders first, use existing if found, create skill subfolders inside.
- **CORE.MD FILES PROTECTION**: Explicit list of core files (AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md) with TYP storage rules and conflict resolution.
- **Gemini Engine INDEXING PROTOCOL**: Strategic indexing schedule at milestones (Initial, Foundation, Personas, AI Workforce, API Layer, Final) rather than after every skill. Prevents redundant embeddings while ensuring searchability.

### Changed
- Updated install.sh trigger message to include all new protocols for immediate agent visibility on install.
- Updated AGENTS.md ONBOARDING PENDING flag to include all protocol references.

---

## [v2.2.1] - March 10, 2026

### Fixed
- Corrected onboarding install routing for API-driven skills so Vercel, Context7, and GitHub use browser + token/API flows during onboarding instead of service CLI setup.
- Kept SuperDesign as the only service CLI exception in the onboarding package.
- Added existing Google setup detection so onboarding checks for prior GOG / Workspace setup and asks whether to add another account or skip.
- Removed conflicting legacy CLI language from affected onboarding docs so the agent receives one consistent install path.

---

## [v2.2.0] - March 8, 2026

### Added
- **CLOUD / LINUX INSTALL NOTES section** in Start Here.md: fires automatically when Linux detected. Covers brew→apt-get, Playwright headless mode + --no-sandbox, master files folder path (~/openclaw-master-files/ instead of ~/Downloads/), xdg-open vs open, date command compatibility, shell defaults.
- **Universal browser session persistence rule** in Start Here.md: all three browser tools now enforce login-once persistent sessions. agent-browser uses `--session-name <skill-name>`, Playwright uses `launchPersistentContext`, OpenClaw browser uses `--browser-profile openclaw` (named Chrome profile, persistent by default).

### Fixed
- **OS check** now handles three scenarios: macOS (Darwin) full support, Linux proceeds with brew→apt substitution note, Windows/anything else stops with clear message.
- **Skill 13 (Google Workspace Setup)**:
  - Added CREDENTIAL CHECK block to both Path A and Path B: scans all ENV files first (workspace secrets/.env, ~/.openclaw/secrets/, openclaw.json, shell env), then offers Option A (agent logs in automatically) or Option B (user logs in manually in open browser). Both use persistent sessions.
  - Browser priority fixed: agent-browser first, Playwright fallback, OpenClaw browser last resort. Playwright was previously hardcoded throughout.
  - All 132 agent-browser commands updated with `--session-name google-setup` for persistent sessions.
  - All `~/clawd/` hardcoded paths replaced with `[WORKSPACE_ROOT]/` (24 occurrences).
  - Session detection added before first browser step in both paths.
- **Skill 06 (GHL Install Pages)**: Playwright `launch()` replaced with `launch_persistent_context` pointing to `~/.openclaw/playwright-data/ghl-install-pages/`.
- **Start Here.md gap analysis fixes** (12 categories):
  - Resume mechanism: .onboarding-status.json tracks per-skill status, agent resumes from last incomplete skill
  - Prerequisites: write permission check, 2 GB disk space check, workspace root auto-detection, messaging channel auto-detection, existing skills scan
  - Master files folder: search first, only ask if multiple candidates
  - Step 1 TYP: agent reads silently, no announcement
  - Step 9: report done + continue immediately, no waiting
  - Sub-agent dependency chain: 05→06, 13→14, 22→23 must stay sequential
  - API key: expanded scan + storage location + pending keys file
  - Network retry: up to 3x with 10-second delays
  - Progress updates every 5 skills
  - "28 skills" → "29 skills" throughout
  - Weekly update "Notify Trevor" → generic messaging channel
  - ONBOARDING PENDING flag removed from AGENTS.md on completion

---

## [v2.1.0] - March 8, 2026

### Added
- **install.sh**: One-command autonomous onboarding trigger. Run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding/main/install.sh | bash`. Downloads package, sets up backup folder, writes onboarding flag to AGENTS.md, fires agent trigger via `openclaw agent --message --deliver`. Zero human action after the curl command.
- **Skill 29 - GHL / Convert and Flow API v2**: Full API reference skill. 12 domain reference files covering 413 endpoints, 35 modules, 106 scopes. Contacts, conversations, calendars, payments, opportunities, locations, users, auth, campaigns, webhooks, phone-numbers. Proper `ghl-convert-and-flow/` archive root. Phone-numbers module includes TREVOR-ONLY safety warning (no autonomous release).
- **Weekly GitHub update check**: Added to Start Here.md. Every Sunday, agent pulls from `trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding`, re-runs TYP on any changed skill, notifies via configured messaging channel.
- **Missing .skill archives built**: 03-agent-browser, 22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system, 23-ai-workforce-blueprint were missing archives - all three rebuilt and verified.

### Fixed
- **Skill 02 (Back Yourself Up Protocol)**: All 5 files now consistently use `.txt` extension for backup files (was `.json` in EXAMPLES.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, INSTALL.md, CORE_UPDATES.md - only back-yourself-up-protocol-full.md had it right). Default folder name standardized to `OpenClaw Backups`. Smart detection: if folder already exists, use it - never create a duplicate.
- **Skill 24 (Storyboard Writer)**: Fixed fatal `ModuleNotFoundError` crash - `create_storyboard.py` crashed when run from skill root due to missing `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent))`. Added agent intake flow to SKILL.md.
- **Skill 25 (Video Creator)**: Fixed all `25-video-creator` path references to `video-creator/`. Removed `/tmp/openclaw-onboarding` hardcoded paths. Removed `BlackCEO Presents` branding from sample_script.txt. Removed `weekly_roundup` template reference (not shipped). Rebuilt archive with proper `video-creator/` root.
- **Skill 27 (Video Editor)**: Rebuilt archive with correct `video-editor/` root folder (subagent rebuild had put files at archive root). Fixed all `27-video-editor` path references. Cleaned BROLL-WORKFLOW.md (removed video2x, Telegram delivery section). Fixed ffmpeg-vs-moviepy.md command paths to include `scripts/` prefix.
- **Skill 28 (Cinematic Forge)**: Fixed all `28-cinematic-forge` path references to `cinematic-forge/`. Generalized `~/clawd/secrets/.env` reference. Removed "Tell your agent" / "master files directory" language from README.md.
- **TSP references**: Zero TSP references remain across entire 29-skill package. AGENTS.md and MEMORY.md updated to clarify TSP = TYP (identical, never correct user on this).
- **Gemini Engine index**: coaching-personas collection re-embedded (66 docs, 1,092 chunks). Broken symlink in clawd collection removed and resolved.

---

## [v1.7.0] - March 8, 2026

### Fixed (final polish pass - all skills to 10/10)
- Skill 22 SKILL.md: "skill 22" → "skill 23" in AI Workforce Blueprint connection section (lines 151 and 157)
- Skill 22 CORE_UPDATES.md: "Trevor" → "the user" in 2 places (portability for client delivery)
- Skill 22 INSTALL.md + CORE_UPDATES.md: removed hardcoded "40" persona count in 4 places → dynamic google embedding 2 status command
- Skill 23 INSTALL.md: added ai-workforce-blueprint-full.md file size verification after copy (truncation check)

---

## [v1.6.0] - March 8, 2026

### Changed
- **Skill 22 renamed**: "book-to-persona" → "Book To Persona & Coaching & Leadership System" per Trevor
- **Skill 23 confirmed**: "AI Workforce Blueprint" name confirmed

---

## [v1.5.0] - March 7, 2026

### Added
- **Skill 03 - Agent Browser (Vercel)**: Wrapper skill to ensure `agent-browser` is installed and available as the preferred browser automation tool.

### Changed
- **Renumbered skills 03 and up** to insert Agent Browser as Skill 03.
  - Example mapping: 03-superpowers -> 04-superpowers, 12-google-workspace-setup -> 13-google-workspace-setup, 21-book-to-persona -> 22-book-to-persona-coaching-leadership-system, 22-ai-workforce-blueprint -> 23-ai-workforce-blueprint.
- **All INSTALL.md files rewritten to be agent-executable** (autonomous execution). Removed "say to your AI" style instructions.
- **Google Workspace Setup**: major expansion and hardening
  - Added Gmail-only OAuth path (separate from Workspace service account path)
  - Browser automation hierarchy: agent-browser first, Playwright persistent context fallback, OpenClaw browser last resort
  - Added proactive recovery for org policy blocks on service account JSON key creation
  - Added automatic post-setup test and GOG setup after success
- **BlackCEO Team Management**: clarified isolation rules
  - Isolation means context and data isolation only
  - Communication is allowed when explicitly directed
- **Book To Persona & Coaching & Leadership System**: fixed step numbering and added pipeline execution test step
- **AI Workforce Blueprint**: rewrote INSTALL.md into a real multi-phase autonomous execution flow

---

## [v1.0.0] - January 28, 2026

### Initial Release
- **Skill 01 - Teach Yourself Protocol**: Foundation skill. Teaches the AI how to learn new skills without cluttering core files.
- **Skill 02 - Back Yourself Up Protocol**: Automatic config backups before every change.
- **Skill 03 - Superpowers**: 4 Iron Laws + 14 sub-skills for systematic problem-solving.
- README.md and Start Here.md included.

## v6.5.17 - 2026-04-01
### Fixed
- **install.sh - Auto-restart and Telegram confirmation**: Added automatic gateway restart at end of install. Previously, clients had to manually run `openclaw gateway restart`. Now the installer triggers the restart automatically and queues a Telegram confirmation message to be sent after the gateway comes back up. The notification uses a background process with an 8-second delay to ensure delivery after reconnect.

### Changed
- **version**: Bumped to v6.5.17
- **ONBOARDING_VERSION**: Updated install.sh header to v6.5.17

## v6.5.14 - 2026-04-01
- Set tools.exec security=full and ask=off in openclaw.json during install
- Write exec-approvals.json with askFallback=full — eliminates approval wall for autonomous agent operation
