  MANDATORY TYP CHECK - READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS CHECK IS COMPLETE.

STEP 1: CHECK IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THE TEACH YOURSELF PROTOCOL (TYP)

Before you read, learn, or execute ANY instruction in this document, you must
verify that you have already been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP).

HOW TO CHECK:
- Look in your AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or MEMORY.md for any mention of:
  "Teach Yourself Protocol" or "TYP"
- Look in your session context for prior TYP training
- Look for a tab called "Teach Yourself Protocol" in this same document

IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
Proceed to the instructions below. Follow the TYP file storage structure.

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TYP:
STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not read further. Do not attempt to learn or execute
anything in this document. Tell the user exactly this:

  "I have not been taught the Teach Yourself Protocol yet. I cannot safely
   learn or execute these instructions until I have been taught TYP first.
   Please share the Teach Yourself Protocol tab with me before we proceed.
   Without TYP, I will bloat your core .md files and waste your tokens."

DO NOT PROCEED PAST THIS POINT WITHOUT TYP CONFIRMED.

TYP FILE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS (only read this if TYP confirmed)

WHEN LEARNING THIS DOCUMENT, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:

1. SAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION TO MASTER FILES FOLDER
   Find the OpenClaw master files folder in ~/Downloads/. It may be named:
   - OpenClaw Master Files
   - OpenClaw Master Documents
   - OpenClaw Documents
   - openclaw-master-files
   - openclaw master files
   - OpenClaw Files
   - openclaw-documents
   - Any variation of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents"
   Search case-insensitively. One word or two words. Plural or singular.
   If no folder is found, create: ~/Downloads/OpenClaw Master Files/

   Save this full document content as a .md file in that folder.

2. DO NOT DUMP FULL CONTENT INTO CORE .MD FILES
   AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md must stay lean.
   Only add a brief summary and a file path reference to where the full
   documentation lives. Never paste thousands of lines into core files.

3. USE THE LABELED SECTIONS BELOW TO KNOW WHAT GOES WHERE
   Look for sections marked:
   [ADD TO AGENTS.md]
   [ADD TO TOOLS.md]
   [ADD TO MEMORY.md]
   Only add what is labeled. Nothing else goes into core files.

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY BEFORE YOU START
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

These rules apply every single time you execute instructions from this document.
No exceptions. No shortcuts. No improvising.

RULE 1: READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANYTHING
Read this entire document from top to bottom before executing a single step.
Do not start executing while still reading. Finish reading first. Then start.

RULE 2: DO NOT CHANGE THE OPERATOR'S INTENT
These instructions say exactly what to do. Execute them exactly as written.
- Do NOT reinterpret steps
- Do NOT "improve" the instructions
- Do NOT skip steps because they seem unnecessary
- Do NOT add steps that are not in the document
- Do NOT change the order of steps
If a step says do X, do X. Not Y. Not a better version of X. X.

RULE 3: NEVER MODIFY THESE WITHOUT PERMISSION
- API keys - copy them exactly, character for character
- Terminal commands - run them exactly as written, no edits
- Config values - use the exact values specified
- Model names - use the exact names specified, spelling matters
- File paths - use the exact paths specified
If you are unsure whether something should be changed, the answer is NO.
Ask the operator. Do not guess. Do not assume.

RULE 4: BUILD YOUR CHECKLIST BEFORE EXECUTING
Before you run a single command or make a single change, create a numbered
checklist of every action this document requires you to take. Write it out.
Show it to the user before starting. Get confirmation. Then execute.

RULE 5: CHECK YOURSELF AGAINST THE CHECKLIST WHEN DONE
When you believe you are finished, go back to your checklist.
Verify every single item was completed. Check it off explicitly.
If anything was missed, complete it before telling the user you are done.
Do NOT tell the user you are done until the checklist is 100% complete.

RULE 6: REPORT WHAT YOU DID
When finished, give the user a clear summary:
- What was completed
- What commands were run
- What files were changed
- Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation that the checklist was fully satisfied

SUPERPOWERS: A DISCIPLINE FRAMEWORK FOR AI AGENTS

Source: https://github.com/obra/superpowers
Skills Reference: https://github.com/obra/superpowers/tree/main/skills

WHAT IT IS:

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow and DISCIPLINE SYSTEM that prevents AI agents from making common mistakes through enforced thinking patterns, Iron Laws, and composable skills.

It works with ANY AI coding agent - Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, or OpenClaw.

Core philosophy: AI agents rationalize skipping proper process. Superpowers makes that impossible. Instead of jumping straight into code, the agent first asks what you are really trying to do, designs a plan, gets your approval, then executes using sub-agents that follow the plan precisely.


THE IRON LAWS (Non-Negotiable):

1. NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
   - Cannot propose a fix until Phase 1 investigation complete
   - Guessing wastes time and creates new bugs

2. NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
   - Wrote code before the test? DELETE IT. Start over.

3. NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
   - "Should pass" is not evidence. Run it.

4. EVIDENCE BEFORE CLAIMS, ALWAYS
   - Never say "Done!" before verification


THE 14 SKILLS (What Gets Downloaded):

Each skill is a folder with a SKILL.md file and sometimes additional reference files.

| # | Skill Name | What It Teaches |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | brainstorming | Ask questions one at a time, propose 2-3 approaches, present design in small chunks, validate each section |
| 2 | systematic-debugging | 4-phase debugging: root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation |
| 3 | test-driven-development | Write the failing test FIRST, then implement, then refactor. No exceptions. |
| 4 | verification-before-completion | Run actual verification commands, show output, never claim done without evidence |
| 5 | writing-plans | Create implementation plans clear enough for a junior engineer with no context |
| 6 | writing-skills | How to write new skills for the framework |
| 7 | executing-plans | How to follow plans step by step without deviation |
| 8 | subagent-driven-development | Spawn sub-agents per task, review their work, continue forward |
| 9 | dispatching-parallel-agents | Run multiple agents in parallel for speed |
| 10 | using-git-worktrees | Isolated workspaces on separate branches |
| 11 | finishing-a-development-branch | Clean up, squash, merge properly |
| 12 | receiving-code-review | How to handle feedback without performative agreement |
| 13 | requesting-code-review | How to review code and give actionable feedback |
| 14 | using-superpowers | Meta-skill: how to use the whole framework |


STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION FOR OPENCLAW:

Step 1: Find or Create the Master Files Folder

The agent must search ~/Downloads/ for the master files folder. It could be named any of these:
- openclaw-master-files
- OpenClaw Master Files
- OpenClaw Master Documents
- OpenClaw Documents
- openclaw master files
- OpenClaw Files
- openclaw-documents
- Any combination of "openclaw" + "master" or "files" or "documents" or "docs"

Search case-insensitively. Check for spaces, hyphens, or no separator.

Command to find it:
find ~/Downloads/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname "*openclaw*" 2>/dev/null

If no folder is found, create one:
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/openclaw-master-files

Step 2: Create the Superpowers Subfolder

mkdir -p [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers

Step 3: Clone or Download the Full Repository

Option A (if git is installed):
cd [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers
git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git .

Option B (if git is not installed):
Download the zip from https://github.com/obra/superpowers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
Unzip it into the superpowers folder.

Option C (download just the skills via API):
For each skill below, download the SKILL.md and any additional files:

curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md" -o [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md

Also download the README:
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/README.md" -o [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers/README.md

Skills with additional files to also download:
- requesting-code-review: code-reviewer.md
- subagent-driven-development: code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md, implementer-prompt.md, spec-reviewer-prompt.md
- systematic-debugging: condition-based-waiting.md, defense-in-depth.md, root-cause-tracing.md, find-polluter.sh
- test-driven-development: testing-anti-patterns.md
- writing-skills: anthropic-best-practices.md, persuasion-principles.md, testing-skills-with-subagents.md

Step 4: Verify the Download

Count the skill folders:
ls -d [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers/skills/*/ | wc -l

Expected result: 14

Check that each skill has a SKILL.md:
for skill in [MASTER_FILES_FOLDER]/superpowers/skills/*/; do
    if [ -f "$skill/SKILL.md" ]; then
        echo "OK: $(basename $skill)"
    else
        echo "MISSING: $(basename $skill)/SKILL.md"
    fi
done

All 14 should say OK. If any say MISSING, re-download that skill.


Step 5: Read and Internalize the Skills

Now the agent must actually READ the downloaded skill files to learn the thinking patterns.

Read each SKILL.md in this order (building from foundation to advanced):
1. using-superpowers/SKILL.md (meta-skill - how the framework works)
2. brainstorming/SKILL.md (before any creative work)
3. systematic-debugging/SKILL.md (before fixing any problems)
4. test-driven-development/SKILL.md (before writing any code)
5. verification-before-completion/SKILL.md (before claiming anything is done)
6. writing-plans/SKILL.md (before implementing anything)
7. executing-plans/SKILL.md (how to follow the plan)
8. subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md (how to use sub-agents)
9. dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md (how to run agents in parallel)
10. writing-skills/SKILL.md (how to create new skills)
11. using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md (isolated development)
12. finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md (clean merge)
13. requesting-code-review/SKILL.md (reviewing others)
14. receiving-code-review/SKILL.md (handling feedback)

For each skill:
- Read the full SKILL.md
- Understand the triggers (when does this skill activate?)
- Understand the process (what steps does the agent follow?)
- Understand the constraints (what is the agent NOT allowed to do?)

After reading all 14, the agent should be able to explain each one in one sentence.


Step 6: Update Core .md Files

Follow the TYP rules - only add summaries and file path references. Never paste full skill content into core files.

14 skill files with full processes. Read the relevant SKILL.md before any coding task.

### THE 4 IRON LAWS (Violations are unacceptable)

IRON LAW 1: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
You found a bug. You think you know what's wrong. STOP.
Do NOT propose a fix until you have investigated the root cause.
Phase 1: Reproduce the bug. Read the error. Trace the code path.
Phase 2: Form a hypothesis based on evidence, not guessing.
Phase 3: Test the hypothesis.
Phase 4: Only THEN implement the fix.
Guessing wastes time and creates new bugs. Every time.
Full process: read systematic-debugging/SKILL.md

IRON LAW 2: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
You need to add a feature. The first thing you write is a TEST that fails.
Not the feature. The test.
If you wrote the code before the test, DELETE IT and start over.
Red (failing test) -> Green (make it pass) -> Refactor (clean it up).
No exceptions. No "I'll add tests later." Now.
Full process: read test-driven-development/SKILL.md

IRON LAW 3: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
You think you're done. "Should work" is NOT evidence.
Run the actual verification command. Show the output. Paste it.
If you cannot show evidence that it works, you are NOT done.
Full process: read verification-before-completion/SKILL.md

IRON LAW 4: EVIDENCE BEFORE CLAIMS, ALWAYS
Never say "Done!" before verification.
Never say "Fixed!" before testing.
Never say "Works!" before running it.
Show the evidence first. Then make the claim.

### THINKING SEQUENCE (Before ANY coding task)

Step 1 - BRAINSTORM: Ask the user what they actually want. One question at a time.
Propose 2-3 approaches with tradeoffs. Present design in digestible chunks.
Get approval on each section before moving on.
Do NOT jump straight into code.

Step 2 - PLAN: Write an implementation plan clear enough for a junior engineer
with no context to follow. Numbered steps. Each step is one action.
Show the plan to the user. Get approval.

Step 3 - EXECUTE: Follow the plan step by step. Use sub-agents for parallel tasks.
Each sub-agent gets one task from the plan. Review their output.

Step 4 - VERIFY: Run the verification. Show the output. Confirm completion.

### ANTI-PATTERNS (Things you are NOT allowed to do)
- Do NOT jump straight to writing code without brainstorming first
- Do NOT guess at bug fixes without investigating root cause
- Do NOT claim "done" without running verification and showing output
- Do NOT write code before writing the failing test
- Do NOT agree with feedback performatively - restate requirements in your own words
- Do NOT skip the plan step because the task "seems simple"

### WORKFLOW MAP
Building something new: brainstorming -> writing-plans -> subagent-driven-development
Fixing a bug: systematic-debugging (4 phases) -> test-driven-development
During implementation: test-driven-development + systematic-debugging
Between tasks: requesting-code-review
After completion: verification-before-completion -> finishing-a-development-branch

- 14 skills, all SKILL.md files verified present
- Agent has read and internalized all 14 skills
- Iron Laws are non-negotiable and apply to every coding task


Step 7: Verification - Prove You Learned It

The agent must demonstrate comprehension by answering these questions correctly:

1. "You found a bug in a function. What do you do FIRST?"
   Correct: Investigate root cause (systematic-debugging Phase 1). Do NOT guess at a fix.

2. "You need to add a new feature. What do you do BEFORE writing any code?"
   Correct: Brainstorm with the user (ask questions one at a time), write a plan, get approval.

3. "You wrote the fix and it seems to work. Can you tell the user it is done?"
   Correct: No. Run the verification command, show the output, THEN say done.

4. "The user wants a new function. What is the first line of code you write?"
   Correct: A failing test for that function. Not the function itself.

5. "You have 10 tasks to implement from a plan. How do you execute them?"
   Correct: Spawn sub-agents (subagent-driven-development), one per task, review their output.

If the agent gets any wrong, re-read the relevant SKILL.md and try again.
