# Skill 42: Personal Assistant Library

## MANDATORY - Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP)

**Before using this skill, complete the Teach Yourself Protocol (Skill 01) on this folder.**

Required read order:
1. SKILL.md (this file) -- overview, component map, relationship to Skill 23
2. INSTALL.md -- one-time setup: prerequisites + materialization steps + verification
3. INSTRUCTIONS.md -- runtime guide: how the agent selects, materializes, and runs a specialist
4. CORE_UPDATES.md -- what gets appended to AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md + MEMORY.md
5. EXAMPLES.md -- worked, copy-pasteable example flows (UNIVERSAL placeholders only)
6. CHANGELOG.md -- version history

Per N3 ("read before act"), do not skip. Per N4, follow steps in declared order.

## Governing protocol (binding for this skill and all skills in the repo)

This skill is governed by ../QC-PROTOCOL.md (repo root) -- the Sub-Agent Handoff and Mandatory QC Protocol. Every install, every PR, every multi-file change runs the 10-category QC rubric (8.5 threshold) BEFORE declaring done. Sub-agents receive full instructions (never summaries). See QC-PROTOCOL.md Part 5 for the sub-agent contract.

## What This Skill Is

**Skill 42 is the Personal Assistant Library** -- a ready-to-deploy collection of 29 personal-life specialists that the agent materializes into the owner's workspace on demand. Where Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint) builds the owner's *business* departments (marketing, sales, billing, CRM, operations), Skill 42 builds the owner's *personal* department: the life/productivity team that manages the owner's inbox, calendar, coaching, emotional support, travel, finances, relationships, spiritual life, and goals.

Each of the 29 specialists is a full sub-workspace spec, not a flat role file. Every specialist folder contains:

- `00-START-HERE.md` -- the read order and orientation for that specialist
- `IDENTITY.md` -- who the specialist is (name, role, mandate, boundaries)
- `SOUL.md` -- the specialist's voice, tone, and operating personality
- `governing-personas.md` -- the 5-layer persona alignment (integrates with Skill 22's persona library)
- `how-to.md` -- the operating playbook
- `ROSTER.md` -- summon conditions: when this specialist activates and what it does
- `SOP/` -- DMAIC standard operating procedures (`00-INDEX.md` + the `PA-NN-NN-slug.md` procedures, named consistently across all 29 specialists)

## Relationship to Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint)

Skill 42 is **additive**, not a replacement. It extends Skill 23 by adding the owner's personal-life department alongside the business departments Skill 23 builds.

- Skill 23's `templates/role-library/` holds one flat `.md` per *business* role. Skill 42's `specialists/` holds 29 full sub-workspace specs for *personal-life* roles. Different taxonomy, different structure.
- Skill 23's `department-naming-map.json` already carries the note: "Personal Assistant department pending proposal -- when approved it will bring the floor to 24." Adding `personal-assistant` to that map's mandatory block (so Skill 23 auto-builds the PA department for every client) is an **optional one-line patch** to Skill 23 -- a product decision, intentionally NOT bundled into this skill's first ship. Skill 23 can reference this library once it is installed without a naming-map change, using Option C (Audit/Resume).
- This skill is a SIBLING of domain-vertical skills 39 (Real Estate Playbook) and 41 (Build With AI Playbook) -- standalone skills that bolt onto Skills 23/38 rather than modifying them.

## Scope & Safety

Several specialists (09 Emotional Support, 24 Superwoman, 26 Therapeutic Support) operate in a **coaching scope only** -- explicitly NOT therapy, medical advice, or crisis intervention. Their SOPs carry crisis-referral protocols (988, NAMI 1-800-950-6264, National DV Hotline 1-800-799-7233) and STOP-and-refer rules. These are public crisis resources, not PII.

28 specialists × 6 role files + Specialist 19's 12 role files = 180 role files, plus 162 `PA-NN-NN-slug.md` SOPs, plus 29 `SOP/00-INDEX.md`, plus `_index.md`. (Specialist 19 ships 6 sub-specialist role files **in addition to** its standard 6-file set — its `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md` are present alongside the sub-roles, not replaced by them. This is an intentional structural exception: the Study Partner is a roster of 6 sub-specialists rather than one specialist, so it carries both the standard orientation set and a sub-role file per member. The QC script (`qc-personal-assistant-library.sh`) and `scripts/verify-pa-install.sh` exempt Specialist 19 from the per-file role check for this reason.)
