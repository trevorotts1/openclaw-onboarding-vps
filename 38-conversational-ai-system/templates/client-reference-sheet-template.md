  Rendering paths:
    1. Notion-first  → scripts/21-generate-client-reference-sheet.sh (agent #5) writes this to a fresh page in the client's Notion workspace, substituting <PLACEHOLDER> tokens with captured run values.
    2. Markdown fallback → if Notion is unavailable, the same script saves the rendered file to $MASTER_FILES_DIR/openclaw-ghl-webhook-setup-<timestamp>.md.

# Part 2 — The Client Reference Sheet (what gets written to Notion or the markdown file)

This is the content the agent generates and saves. Every code block in the reference sheet must be a real, copy-paste-ready code block so the operator can hit the "copy" button and paste straight into GHL.

## Reference Sheet structure

# OpenClaw Inbound Webhook Setup — Client Reference Sheet

**Setup completed:** <date and time>
**Hostname:** <PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>
**OpenClaw version at setup time:** <OPENCLAW_VERSION>
**Hook name (mapping id):** <HOOK_NAME>
**Endpoint URL:** https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/<HOOK_NAME>

## 🚀 GHL CUSTOM WEBHOOK SETUP (copy-paste sections)

For EACH channel you want OpenClaw to handle, build a separate workflow in GHL. Copy the matching JSON block from Part 3 below. Use these same values across all workflows:

### URL field (same for every channel)

[code block, copy button]
https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/<HOOK_NAME>
[/code block]

### Headers (same for every channel)

Leave the "AUTHORIZATION" dropdown set to "None". Add these as manual headers — watch for extra spaces, no leading/trailing whitespace, double-check spelling:

[code block, copy button]
Authorization: Bearer <HOOKS_TOKEN>
[/code block]

[code block, copy button]
Content-Type: application/json
[/code block]

### Content-Type dropdown (below Headers)

Set to: application/json

## 📦 GHL WORKFLOW BUILD — DO THIS FOR EACH CHANNEL

(Verbatim click-by-click — see Part 3 for the matching Raw Body per channel)

1. GHL sub-account → **Automation → Workflows → + Create Workflow → Start from Scratch**
2. Name it `OpenClaw — Inbound [Channel]` (e.g. `OpenClaw — Inbound SMS`)
3. **+ Add New Trigger** → choose **Customer Replied**
4. In the trigger filter: **+ Add Filter** → choose **Reply Channel** → select the matching channel (SMS, Email, Facebook, Instagram, Live Chat, or All-in-One Chat)
5. Hit **Save Trigger**
6. Below the trigger, click the **+** button in the middle of the canvas
7. In the popup, type **webhook** in the search box
8. Choose **Custom Webhook** (NOT GHL's native webhook action — they are different)
9. Method: **POST**
10. URL: paste the URL block from above
11. AUTHORIZATION dropdown: leave as **None**
12. Under HEADERS, click **Add another item** TWICE to create two rows:
    - Row 1 — Key: `Authorization` | Value: paste the Authorization block (full string including `Bearer ` and the trailing `=`)
    - Row 2 — Key: `Content-Type` | Value: `application/json`
13. CONTENT-TYPE dropdown: set to `application/json`
14. Scroll to **RAW BODY** field
15. Paste the matching JSON from Part 3 (SMS body for SMS workflow, Email body for Email workflow, etc.)
16. Click **Save Action**
17. Top middle of the workflow → click **Settings** tab → turn **Allow Reentry** ON
18. Top right → toggle from **Draft** to **Publish**
19. Top → hit the **Save** button above the toggle
20. Test: send yourself a message in the matching channel from GHL, reply from your phone/inbox, and watch for the agent's reply

⚠️ Reminders:
- One workflow per channel — don't try to combine them
- Watch for extra spaces when pasting — leading or trailing whitespace breaks auth
- The `channel` value in each JSON is hardcoded to match the workflow's channel filter — don't change it

## 🛠️ Setup Verification

- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
- ✅ DNS CNAME created at <PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>
- ✅ cloudflared service: auto-start flags verified, Restart Survival Test passed
- ✅ OpenClaw config: backup at <CONFIG_BACKUP_PATH>, hooks.mappings active for <HOOK_NAME>
- ✅ End-to-end test: 200 OK at https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/<HOOK_NAME>
- ✅ OpenClaw version at time of setup: <OPENCLAW_VERSION> (schema verified against docs.openclaw.ai on <date>)
- ✅ Agent classification rules installed in AGENTS.md (spam/marketing filtering active)
- ✅ Communication playbooks created (links below)

## 📘 Your communication playbooks

The agent reads these on every reply turn. Open each one and fill in the sections for your business — tone, signature, example replies, escalation rules. The agent picks up changes automatically; no restart needed.

- SMS Communication Playbook: <URL or path>
- Email Communication Playbook: <URL or path>
- Facebook Communication Playbook: <URL or path>
- Instagram Communication Playbook: <URL or path>

The agent will use professional defaults until you fill these in. Filling them in is what makes replies sound like YOUR business.

## 🧪 How to test your live system

After you've built your GHL workflow(s) and published them, run this end-to-end test for at least one channel (SMS is the easiest):

1. **Open GHL → Conversations → New conversation**
2. **Send a test text to your own phone**: type your own mobile number, write "test message", and send it through GHL
3. **From your phone, REPLY to that text** (don't just open it — actually reply with something like "hello, is anyone there?")
4. **Switch back to GHL → Automation → Workflows → [your OpenClaw workflow] → Execution Log tab**
5. **Look for your execution**: it should appear within a few seconds. Click on it to expand the details.
6. **Check the webhook response code**:
   - ✅ **200** → OpenClaw received it. Continue to step 7.
   - ❌ **401** → Bearer token wrong. Re-check the Authorization header in your GHL workflow (no extra spaces).
   - ❌ **404** → URL wrong. Re-check the webhook URL (should end in `/hooks/<HOOK_NAME>`).
   - ❌ **500** → OpenClaw error. Check OpenClaw logs: `openclaw logs --tail 50`.
7. **Switch to your AI agent (the one that runs your OpenClaw)** and ask: "Did you receive a webhook from GHL? Did you process it?"
8. **Verify the agent's reply came through**: within a few seconds of step 3, your phone should have received an SMS response from the agent (sent via GHL's Conversations API using the installed GHL skill).

If the agent received the webhook but didn't reply, check:
- Was your test message classified as spam/marketing by the agent? (If you typed "I want to sell you something", it would correctly ignore that. Use a normal-sounding message like "Hi, can you help me with something?")
- Is the GHL skill installed and enabled? Confirm with: `openclaw skills list | grep -i ghl`
- Is your GHL Private Integration Token (PIT) configured for the skill? Check the skill's settings.

If the agent replied but the reply sounds robotic or generic, that's expected — go fill in your Communication Playbooks (above) with your tone, examples, and brand voice. The agent will sound like YOUR business after that.

## 🔄 Recall prompt — save this somewhere durable

Paste this into any AI session with access to this machine to retrieve your URL + Bearer token later:

[code block]
Look up my OpenClaw hooks.mappings setup in ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.
Tell me the URL pattern (https://<hostname>/hooks/<id>), the Bearer token
(hooks.token), and the agent session key pattern (mappings[].sessionKey).
Resolve the hostname from my Cloudflare tunnel if not in memory. Output
ready-to-paste headers and URL for an external service.
[/code block]

## 🔌 Adding other services later

To wire Stripe, n8n, Calendly, Zapier, or any other service into the same OpenClaw, add another entry to the `hooks.mappings` array in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with its own `id`, `match.path`, and a `messageTemplate` shaped for that service's payload. Reuses the same `HOOKS_TOKEN`. URL becomes `https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/<new-id>`.
```

# Part 3 — Six channel-specific Raw Body JSONs

These are the Raw Body blocks the operator pastes into GHL's Custom Webhook action. ONE block per channel, ONE workflow per channel. The `channel` field is hardcoded because GHL's `{{message.channel}}` merge field doesn't reliably populate — and since each workflow's trigger filter already constrains the channel, hardcoding is correct.

All six blocks have the same structure. Only the `channel` value changes. The operator copies the block matching the channel they're setting up.

### SMS workflow — Raw Body

```json
{
  "channel": "sms",
  "contact": {
    "id": "{{contact.id}}",
