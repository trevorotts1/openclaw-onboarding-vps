# Part 2 — Remaining Features (ordered by priority)

Sixteen features remain unimplemented. Build order reflects revenue impact and strategic value, with the Conversational Sales AI cluster slotted FIRST since sales-driven outcomes are the primary value driver for Convert and Flow's client base.

---

# Sales AI Cluster (Features 26-31) — TOP PRIORITY

## ✅ Feature 26 — Conversational Sales AI Best Practices Module (shipped in v5.7)

**Status:** Implemented in Step 9.23 of the main playbook.

**What it does:** The sales BRAIN. Six conversation phases (Open / Discover / Present / Handle Objections / Close / Follow Up). Three discovery frameworks (BANT, MEDDIC, SPICED) — operator picks per product. Six objection patterns with response templates. Buyer signal recognition. Pricing reveal timing rules. Trial-close phrasing. Honesty floor (never fabricate, never deceive, never false urgency). Reads client-specific content from `knowledgebases/sales/`. AGENTS.md Step 1.8 activates this layer when sales context detected.

## ✅ Feature 27 — Product Knowledge Layer (subsumed by Feature 38 in v5.6)

**Status:** Implemented as the `products/` typed knowledge base inside Feature 38 (Step 9.22).

## ✅ Feature 28 — Discount Code Generation (GHL + Stripe) (shipped in v5.10)

**Status:** Implemented in Step 9.26.

## ✅ Feature 33 — Intelligent Playbook Routing (shipped in v5.13)

**Status:** Implemented in Step 9.33. Cosine similarity 0.3 advantage to switch. Max 3 switches per conversation.

## ✅ Feature 34 — Proactive Features Suite (shipped in v5.13)

---

# Remaining Round 2 Features (lower priority — DEFERRED, NOT in v5.14)

## 📋 Feature 14 — Voice/Phone Integration
## 📋 Feature 15 — Proactive Outreach Campaigns
## 📋 Feature 16 — A/B Testing of Reply Variants
## 📋 Feature 17 — Customer Segmentation Awareness
## 📋 Feature 18 — Webhook Chaining (downstream triggers)
## 📋 Feature 21 — Multi-Tenant Agent Isolation

These six are explicitly NOT implemented in v5.14 and NOT in skill 38. The skill's structure
(numbered scripts, protocols/ folder, references/) leaves room for them to be added later
without restructuring.

---

# Part 3 — What's NOT on the roadmap

- Customer satisfaction surveys (low signal; sentiment monitoring covers this)
- Chatbot-style FAQ matcher (Convert and Flow snippets cover this)
- In-conversation upselling without consent (bad UX)
- Auto-translation of agent's reply (superseded by Feature 8)

---

# Implementation status (skill 38)

**Shipped in skill 38 (v5.14):** All ✅ features above. Skill 38 packages 27 protocol files (humanizer-protocol.md intentionally NOT shipped — skill 19 owns it).

**Pending (NOT in skill 38):** F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F21.

---

# Portability statement

All features are platform-neutral. The protocols are markdown instruction documents. If
a client migrates from OpenClaw to another conversational AI platform, these protocols
travel intact.
