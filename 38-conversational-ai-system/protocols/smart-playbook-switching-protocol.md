## The model — an always-listening layer parallel to the active workflow

While ANY conversation workflow is active, a lightweight **always-listening
layer** runs in parallel on every inbound. It does NOT draft the reply; it only
asks: "does this inbound contain something that must interrupt the current
workflow?" If yes, it fires a DETOUR:

```
SAVE workflow state  →  EXECUTE the interrupt sub-flow  →  RETURN to saved state (soft transition)
```

The active workflow's step, gathered data, and context are preserved across the
detour, so the customer never has to repeat themselves.

## Interrupt triggers (what the always-listening layer watches for)

A detour fires when the inbound matches any of:

1. **Operator urgent keywords** — operator-configured words that mean "stop and
   handle this" (e.g. "urgent", "emergency", "cancel my order now", or custom
   per-client words from the operator's config). Operator-defined in
   `<MASTER_FILES_DIR>/interrupt-triggers.md`.
2. **FAQ types** — a question that the FAQ layer (F47,
   `smart-faq-tool-protocol.md`) can answer in one sentence. NOTE: F47 is the
   *lightweight sibling* — a SENTENCE, not a sub-flow — and is the preferred,
   cheapest detour for a simple factual question. F44 owns the heavier
   sub-flow detours; F47 handles the one-liner case (see "Relationship to F47").
3. **Compliance redirects** — a mid-workflow message that trips a compliance
   keyword (Step 0.7) requiring an immediate compliance response before anything
   else.
4. **F50 aggression** — a Tier-2 aggression firing
   (`aggression-detection-protocol.md`) routes to the aggression-handler sub-flow
   as a detour, then returns (tag `ZHC-aggression-handled-and-resumed`).
5. **F49 pixel-priority** — if pixel/tracking-priority signals are enabled, a
   high-priority pixel event can interrupt to capture the moment, then return.

## State save / execute / return

### 1. SAVE workflow state

Before executing the sub-flow, the agent writes a state snapshot (to the contact
log header and the interrupt JSONL) capturing:

- `active_workflow_id`
- `active_step` (which phase/step of the workflow the customer was in)
- `gathered_data` (everything collected so far — name, package interest, dates,
  answers — so nothing is re-asked)
- `context` (a one-line summary of where the conversation was)

### 2. EXECUTE the interrupt sub-flow

Run the triggering sub-flow (operator-urgent handler, compliance response,
aggression-handler, etc.) to completion or to a natural handoff point.

### 3. RETURN to the saved state with a SOFT transition

Restore the saved workflow + step + gathered data, and re-enter with a soft,
human transition so the customer feels the agent never lost the thread:

- "Coming back to where we were…"
- "Okay — back to your booking. You'd told me [gathered_data], so the next thing
  is…"
- "Thanks for your patience on that — picking up the [topic] we were working on…"

Apply the tag matching the detour kind (see Tags) on return.

## Depth and multiple triggers

- **Max 2 levels deep.** A detour may itself be interrupted once (level 2). A
  THIRD nested interrupt is not allowed — at that point the agent **escalates to
  a human** (the conversation is too tangled to keep auto-detouring) and notifies
  the operator. This prevents infinite nesting / state-stack blowups.
- **Multiple triggers in one inbound → highest priority first, queue the rest.**
  Priority order (highest → lowest):
  1. Compliance redirect (hard-gate, always wins)
  2. F50 aggression (Tier 2)
  3. Operator urgent keyword
  4. F49 pixel-priority
  5. FAQ type (→ usually handed to F47 as a one-liner, not a full detour)

  The highest-priority trigger detours first; the others queue and fire in order
  after the current detour returns (subject to the 2-level cap — if firing a
  queued trigger would exceed depth 2, escalate instead).

## Tags

All applied programmatically → `ZHC-` prefix (zhc-tag-prefix-protocol.md):

- `ZHC-interrupt-handled` — a detour fired and returned cleanly.
- `ZHC-faq-detoured` — the detour was an FAQ-type interrupt.
- `ZHC-aggression-handled-and-resumed` — an F50 aggression detour ran and the
  conversation returned to its saved state.

## Relationship to F47 (smart FAQ tool)

F47 (`smart-faq-tool-protocol.md`) is the **lightweight sibling**: a SENTENCE,
not a sub-flow. When the interrupt is a simple factual question the FAQ knowledge
base can answer in one line, the always-listening layer hands it to F47, which
answers inline ("By the way, [answer]. Coming back to [topic]…") and the
conversation continues on the same step — no state save/restore needed. F44 owns
the heavier case where the interrupt needs an actual sub-flow (operator-urgent
handler, compliance response, aggression-handler). Use F47 for one-liners; use
F44 for sub-flows.

## Relationship to F33 (intelligent routing) — the disambiguation

| | F33 — Intelligent Routing (route-and-stay) | F44 — Smart Switching (detour-and-return) |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | the conversation genuinely PIVOTED to a new topic | something urgent must be handled, but the original goal stands |
| Action | SWITCH the active workflow; stay there | SAVE state → run sub-flow → RETURN to the saved workflow |
| State | the old workflow is left behind | the old workflow's step + data are preserved and resumed |
| Soft transition | "Sounds like this is more about X now — switching gears" | "Coming back to where we were…" |
| Cap | max 3 switches / conversation | max 2 detour levels deep, then escalate |
| Step | 9.33 | 9.38 |

If a customer permanently moves on, that is F33. If they need a quick aside and
then want to finish what they started, that is F44.

## openclaw.json toggles

```json
{
  "skill38": {
    "smart_playbook_switching": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_interrupt_depth": 2
    }
  }
}
```

- `smart_playbook_switching.enabled` — default **true** (always-listening interrupts on).
- `smart_playbook_switching.max_interrupt_depth` — default **2**; beyond it, escalate to
  the operator rather than nest further.

## MEMORY.md (Rule 22)

The agent always listens for interrupts in parallel with the active workflow. On an
interrupt (operator-urgent keyword, FAQ type, compliance redirect, F50 aggression, F49
pixel-priority) it SAVES the workflow state, EXECUTES the sub-flow, then RETURNS to the
saved step with a soft "coming back to where we were" transition. This is
DETOUR-AND-RETURN, distinct from Step 9.33's route-and-stay. Max 2 levels deep, then
escalate. Multiple triggers: highest priority first, queue the rest. See
`<MASTER_FILES_DIR>/smart-playbook-switching-protocol.md`.

## Logging (the data contract — F52)

Every interrupt is recorded as JSONL, one line appended to
`<MASTER_FILES_DIR>/interrupt-log.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-05-30T15:01:12Z","event_type":"interrupt_detour","contact_id":"<CONTACT_ID>","channel":"sms","trigger_kind":"operator_urgent","priority":3,"depth":1,"saved_workflow_id":"appointment-booking","saved_step":"phase-2-gather-context","gathered_data_keys":["name","preferred_day"],"subflow":"urgent-cancellation-handler","queued_triggers":[],"tag_applied":"ZHC-interrupt-handled","returned":true,"escalated":false}
```

JSONL schema (one object per line):

| field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | string (ISO-8601 UTC) | when the interrupt fired |
| `event_type` | string | `interrupt_detour` (always, for F44 firings) |
| `contact_id` | string | GHL contact id |
| `channel` | string | inbound channel |
| `trigger_kind` | string | `operator_urgent` / `faq_type` / `compliance_redirect` / `aggression` / `pixel_priority` |
| `priority` | number | 1 (highest) … 5 (lowest), per the priority order above |
| `depth` | number | nesting depth at firing (1 or 2; 3 = escalate, not allowed) |
| `saved_workflow_id` | string | the workflow paused for the detour |
| `saved_step` | string | the step within that workflow |
| `gathered_data_keys` | array of string | the keys of the preserved gathered data (NOT the values — keeps PII out of the log) |
| `subflow` | string | the interrupt sub-flow that ran |
| `queued_triggers` | array of string | any other triggers queued behind this one |
| `tag_applied` | string | `ZHC-interrupt-handled` / `ZHC-faq-detoured` / `ZHC-aggression-handled-and-resumed` |
| `returned` | boolean | whether the conversation returned to the saved state |
| `escalated` | boolean | whether the 2-level cap was hit and the agent escalated to a human |
