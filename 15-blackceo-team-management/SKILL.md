# Skill 15: BlackCEO Team Management

## What This Skill Is About

This skill sets up a system where multiple people can send messages to the same AI bot on Telegram, and each person gets their own dedicated worker running in the background. Instead of messages piling up and bleeding into each other, the main AI session acts as a "dispatcher" that routes each person's request to their own private worker sub-agent.

Think of it like a receptionist at a front desk. When Person A calls, the receptionist routes them to Assistant A. When Person B calls, they get routed to Assistant B. Each assistant only sees their own conversation. The receptionist (dispatcher) can see everything, but the assistants stay separate.

This is the team management protocol - built as a configurable template that works for any client deployment, any team size, any set of people.

## When to Use This Skill

- You are setting up OpenClaw to serve multiple team members through one Telegram bot
- You need to configure message routing so each person gets their own worker sub-agent
- You are adding new team members or clients to an existing dispatcher setup
- You need to create or update the WORKFLOW_AUTO.md routing table
- You are troubleshooting why messages are crossing between users or workers are not spawning
- You need to configure Telegram ID allowlists so new people can message the bot
- You are setting up model selection rules for different types of worker tasks
- You need to understand the difference between "worker" team members and "client" users

## What This Skill Covers

- The dispatcher/worker architecture and how it works step by step
- How to configure sub-agent settings in openclaw.json (max concurrent workers, archive timing, model selection)
- Adding Telegram IDs to the allowFrom list so the bot accepts messages from team members
- Creating the WORKFLOW_AUTO.md routing table that maps each person to their worker
- Worker lifecycle: how workers are created, stay active, go idle, get archived, and respawn
- Context isolation rules so one person's conversation never leaks into another person's worker (separate context windows, not communication lockdown - workers CAN send directed messages to any Telegram ID when explicitly asked)
- Cross-worker communication through the dispatcher (when someone asks to share info between workers)
- Model selection for different task types (routine work vs. creative vs. complex reasoning)
- The difference between "worker" sub-agents (team members who give instructions) and "client" sub-agents (clients who are served, never assigned tasks)
- Scaling guidelines for teams of different sizes
- A complete WORKFLOW_AUTO.md template ready to copy and customize
- Deployment checklist for setting up a new client
- What to add to AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md so the agent remembers team IDs across sessions

## Key Things the AI Agent Must Know

1. **The main session is the dispatcher, not a worker.** It receives all incoming messages, looks up the sender's Telegram ID, and routes the task to the correct worker sub-agent. It does not do the work itself.

2. **Configure any team size (2-20 members).** During setup, the agent collects each team member's name, Telegram ID, role, and contact method. This data is stored in TEAM_CONFIG.md and the routing table. There are no hardcoded IDs - every deployment starts from a fresh intake.

3. **Workers stay alive between tasks.** When you spawn a worker with cleanup: keep, it stays active even after finishing a task. The next message from that same person goes to the existing worker instead of spawning a new one. Workers only archive after 30 days of inactivity.

4. **All workers are lost on gateway restart.** This is expected. The dispatcher automatically re-spawns each worker when that person sends their next message. No manual fix needed.

5. **Context isolation is strict by default.** Person A's conversation data and context never appears in Person B's worker. Directed message sends are ALWAYS allowed - if someone says 'send [person] a message,' execute it immediately. What is isolated is conversation data, not the ability to communicate.

6. **WORKFLOW_AUTO.md is not read at boot.** It is a custom file, not a standard OpenClaw file. The critical team IDs must also be written to AGENTS.md and MEMORY.md so the agent remembers them every session.

7. **Client sub-agents are different from worker sub-agents.** Workers receive instructions and execute tasks. Clients are served respectfully - the AI never assigns them tasks or bosses them around. Mark clients clearly in the routing table.

8. **The sub-agent model must support tool calls.** Models that only do reasoning (no tool calls) will fail silently as workers. Use MiniMax M2.5, Codex, or Sonnet as defaults.
