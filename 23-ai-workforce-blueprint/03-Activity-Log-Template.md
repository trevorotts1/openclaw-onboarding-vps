## QMD Integration

- Every morning: run `qmd update` + `qmd embed` on yesterday's completed log
- Current day's live log is never embedded mid-day
- End of year: move all daily logs to `archive/YYYY/` and QMD embed the archive

---

## Annual Archive Protocol

At the start of each new year:
1. Create `archive/[previous year]/` folder
2. Move all daily log files from the previous year into it
3. Run `qmd update` + `qmd embed` on the archive
4. Keep the archive permanently — never auto-delete
5. Deletion is the owner's decision only

---

## Rules

1. Log entries are appended in real time as things happen — never wait until end of day
2. Every cross-dept request and delivery gets a log entry
3. Every new SOP creation gets a log entry
4. Keep entries to one line — concise is the standard
5. Use Job IDs consistently to make searching easy
6. If QMD is not installed, daily logs still work — they're just plain .md files
