# AI Workforce Blueprint - Build Instructions

## The 3 Options

When you trigger this skill, you will see 3 options. Choose the one that fits your situation:

---

### Option A - Full Automated Build 🚀 (Recommended)

**Best for:** First-time setup, new businesses, or reorganizing

**What happens:**
1. I show you 10 pre-built departments you can choose from
2. You decide: Keep all / Keep some / Add custom / Start from scratch
3. I interview you about your business (with examples for each question)
4. I build all folders and files automatically based on your answers

**Pre-built departments available:**

• marketing-dept - Content, ads, social media, email campaigns
• sales-dept - Converting leads to customers
• billing-dept - Invoicing, payments, financial tracking
• customer-support-dept - Helping existing clients
• operations-dept - Day-to-day business running
• creative-dept - Graphics, video, content creation
• hr-people-dept - Team management, hiring
• legal-compliance-dept - Contracts, regulations
• it-tech-dept - Software, websites, infrastructure
• master-orchestrator-dept - Routes all work (always included)

**Interview questions include:**
- What is your business name?
- In one sentence, what does your business do?
- What is your current team size?
- What are the main tools your business uses?
- What is your biggest challenge right now?
- Do you have existing SOPs or training materials?

Each question includes examples so you know what kind of answer to give.

**To choose this option:** Say "Build my AI workforce - Option A"

### Option B - Manual Build 🛠️

**Best for:** Hands-on users who want full control

**What happens:**
- You read ai-workforce-blueprint-full.md
- You build everything yourself following the blueprint
- You have complete control over every detail

**To choose this option:** Say "Build my AI workforce - Option B"

---

### Option C - Audit / Resume Mode 🔍

**Best for:** Returning users, adding personas later, checking for gaps

**What happens:**
1. I scan your existing workforce folder
2. I add any missing files (good-examples.md, bad-examples.md, tools.md)
3. If Coaching Personas are installed, I wire them to all departments
4. I never overwrite or delete anything existing

**Use this when:**
- You installed Skill 22 (personas) after building your workforce
- You added new departments and need them audited
- You want to make sure nothing is missing
- Any time you re-run the script

**To choose this option:** Say "Audit my AI workforce" or "Build my AI workforce - Option C"

## The Required Files in Every Role Folder

Every role folder MUST have these files. No exceptions.

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `00-START-HERE.md` | First file the AI reads. What this role does, who owns it, what tools it uses, where to find files |
| `01-[task-name].md` | How-to file for task 1. Numbered, sequential |
| `02-[task-name].md` | How-to file for task 2 |
| (continue numbering) | One file per major task |
| `good-examples.md` | Examples of excellent output for this role |
| `bad-examples.md` | Examples of bad output - what to avoid |
| `tools.md` | List of every tool this role uses with login locations and instructions |

## The Routing File (Universal SOPs)

Every workforce structure needs one routing file at the top level:
`universal-sops/00-ROUTING.md`

This file tells the AI:
- Which department owns each type of task
- Which role inside that department handles it
- Which specific file in that role folder to read first

Without a routing file, the AI guesses. With a routing file, the AI always goes to the right place.

## Naming Convention (Non-Negotiable)

- Department folders: `[name]-dept/` (e.g., `sales-dept/`, `marketing-dept/`)
- Role folders: descriptive lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `lead-generation/`, `content-writer/`)
- Files: numbered with two digits (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) so they sort correctly
- No spaces in folder or file names. Ever.

## Signs Your Structure Is Working

- Your AI routes tasks to the right department without being told
- Output is consistent - same quality every time
- You can walk away and the AI keeps working
- Adding a new task means adding one .md file, not re-explaining everything
- New team members (human or AI) can onboard themselves by reading the folders

## Interview-Style Questions (Option A)

When you choose Option A, I will ask questions interview-style. This means:

✓ Each question includes an example answer
✓ I check what I already know about you before asking
✓ Questions are conversational, not robotic

**Example question format:**

Q: What is your business name?  
Example: Acme Coaching, BlackCEO, Otts Consulting  
[Your answer]: _____

Q: What are the main tools your business uses?  
Example: GoHighLevel, Slack, Google Workspace, QuickBooks  
[Your answer]: _____

This makes it easy to answer - you see exactly what kind of information I am looking for.

## Context Awareness

Before asking questions, I check:
- Your MEMORY.md for business info
- Your USER.md for preferences
- Your AGENTS.md for known tools
- Your IDENTITY.md for context

If I already know something (like your business name), I will use that info and skip the question.

## Telegram-Friendly Output

All messages from this skill use Telegram-friendly formatting:

✓ No markdown tables  
✓ No code blocks  
✓ Short lines with bullets (• or -)  
✓ Emojis for visual breaks  

This makes it easy to read on mobile devices.
