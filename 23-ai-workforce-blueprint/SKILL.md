# AI Workforce Blueprint Skill

## What This Is

This skill builds the folder and file system that turns your AI agent into a trained workforce.

Without this system, your AI forgets between sessions, gives inconsistent results, and you spend all day repeating yourself. With this system, your AI knows which department owns every task, which role handles it, and exactly which file tells it how to do the work.

**This is completely separate from the Coaching Personas Matrix.** Personas govern HOW an agent thinks and communicates. This blueprint governs WHERE the agent works and WHAT it does. They work together but neither requires the other.

## What It Creates

When you run this skill, your AI builds:

```
[your-workspace]/
  sales-dept/
    [role-folder]/
      00-START-HERE.md
      01-[how-to-file].md
      02-[how-to-file].md
      good-examples.md
      bad-examples.md
      tools.md
  marketing-dept/
    [role-folder]/
      ...
  ops-dept/
  finance-dept/
  coaching-dept/
  leadership-dept/
  universal-sops/
    00-ROUTING.md
    tools.md
```

## When to Trigger This Skill

- User wants to set up their AI company structure
- User says "build my departments" or "scaffold my workspace"
- User is starting a new business or reorganizing an existing one
- User wants their AI to stop forgetting and start operating consistently

## Files in This Skill

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SKILL.md | This file - the trigger and overview |
| INSTALL.md | How to install and run this skill |
| INSTRUCTIONS.md | Step-by-step walkthrough of the build process |
| EXAMPLES.md | Real examples of good department/role structures |
| CORE_UPDATES.md | What to add to your core memory files after install |
| ai-workforce-blueprint-full.md | The complete 66,819-character blueprint document |
| scripts/build-workforce.py | Automated scaffold script - creates all folders and starter files |

## How to Use

**Option A - Automated (recommended):**
When triggered, execute INSTALL.md beginning at Phase 5. Run `scripts/build-workforce.py` which walks the user through questions and creates everything.

**Option B - Manual:**
Read `ai-workforce-blueprint-full.md` and follow the step-by-step instructions to build the structure.

**Option C - Resume:**
If a workforce structure already exists, run the scaffold script in audit mode. It scans existing folders and fills gaps without overwriting.

## Connection to Book To Persona & Coaching & Leadership System (Skill 22)

**Skill 23 works independently.** If Skill 22 (Book To Persona & Coaching & Leadership System) is not installed, the workforce blueprint builds clean with no persona references. Personas are an enhancement, not a requirement. Install Skill 23 at any time, regardless of whether Skill 22 is installed.

These two skills are separate but work together automatically when both are present.

**If Skill 22 (book-to-persona) is installed:**
- The scaffold script detects the `coaching-personas` QMD collection
- Every department folder automatically gets a `governing-personas.md` file listing which personas govern that department
- Every `00-START-HERE.md` gets a Governing Personas section with QMD query instructions
- Agents in each department know exactly which persona methodology to follow

**If Skill 22 is NOT installed:**
- Structure builds clean with no persona references
- Install Skill 22 later, then re-run the scaffold in Option C (audit mode)
- It will detect personas and wire them in retroactively without touching existing files
