# AI Workforce Blueprint

## The Philosophy

"The whole point of this system is to BUILD them into running a real company. Not quiz them on shit they don't know. The AI should be the expert that guides them, not a survey that interrogates them."

This skill serves new entrepreneurs and business owners who have never successfully run a company. The AI is their business partner. It leads with knowledge. It suggests answers. It detects when they are stuck and helps them through it. It never uses jargon. It never makes them feel stupid.

**Forbidden terms in client-facing interactions:**
- SOPs (say "step-by-step instructions" or "how things get done")
- Handoffs (say "what this department sends to other departments")
- Tech stack (say "tools you use")
- Permanent agent (never mention)
- Sub-agent (never mention)
- Agent (say "team member" or "specialist" or "director")

## What This Skill Does

This is the SINGLE skill that builds a client's entire AI company. It replaces what used to be three separate skills (Skills 23, 33, and 34) with one unified flow:

1. **Interviews the client** about their business using dynamic, plain-English questions (3-7 per department based on complexity and what the AI already knows)
2. **Creates departments** based on interview answers (could be 5, 17, or 50 - never hardcoded)
3. **Hires department heads** as permanent agents with full workspaces and core files
4. **Determines specialists** - the AI silently decides which roles are full-time team members (permanent agents) vs on-call specialists (spawned when needed). The client never hears these technical terms.
5. **Assigns coaching personas** using the Act As If Protocol and 5-layer alignment check
6. **Sets up workspaces** with inherited files (TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md from main) and unique files (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, memory/ folder)
7. **Generates the org chart** (ORG-CHART.md in the CEO workspace)
8. **Creates the Devil's Advocate** in every department automatically
9. **Generates the Command Center config** (departments.json for the dashboard)

## How It Connects to the System

### Skill Pipeline
Skill 22 (Book-to-Persona Coaching Leadership System) builds coaching personas
--> **Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint)** interviews, creates departments, creates agents, assigns personas, generates org chart
--> BlackCEO Command Center displays and manages everything

### What Skill 22 Provides
Skill 22 converts books into persona blueprints. These personas are organized by category:

**12 Domain Tags:** Marketing, Sales, Leadership, Finance, Operations, Communication, Copywriting, Mindset, Productivity/Systems, Coaching, Strategy/Innovation, Personal Development

**6 Perspective Tags:** African American experience, Women's challenges, Men's challenges, Family/relationships, Faith/spirituality, Love/romantic relationships

When Skill 23 assigns personas to agents and tasks, it first filters by category (a marketing task pulls marketing-tagged personas, not finance personas), then runs the 5-layer alignment on those candidates. Tags are stored in persona-categories.json in the coaching-personas folder. This category filtering is how the system efficiently searches 40+ personas (and eventually 1000+) without reading every single blueprint.

### What the Command Center Consumes
The Command Center reads:
- departments.json (which departments exist, their names, emoji, head titles)
- company-config.json (company KPIs, industry, connected systems)
- department-config.json per department (department KPIs, specialist assignments)
- ORG-CHART.md (organizational structure)
- persona-matrix.md (which personas are available and pre-qualified)
- governing-personas.md per role folder (persona matching reference guide, NOT static assignment)
- persona-matching-protocol.md (5-layer runtime persona matching: mission, values, company goals, department goals, task fit)

## Model Requirements

**This skill MUST run on a high reasoning model.** The decisions it makes (department structure, specialist determination, persona alignment) shape the entire company. Wrong choices cascade into everything.

**Approved models:**
- anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
- openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-pro (with thinking enabled)
- google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
- openai-codex/gpt-5.4

**Forbidden for this skill:**
- moonshot/kimi-k2.5
- google/gemini-3-flash-preview
- google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview

**If the client is on a low reasoning model:**
Say: "For setting up your company, I recommend switching to a model that thinks more deeply so we get the best results. Want me to switch?"

**Research model:** When the AI offers to research industry best practices, it uses openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro-search.

## The Three Options

When this skill triggers, it ALWAYS presents three options. Never skip this. Never auto-select.

**Option A - Full Interview (recommended)**
The AI interviews you about your business. Asks 3-7 questions per department based on complexity and what it already knows. Builds everything from your answers. Most personalized.

**Option B - Quick Setup (fastest)**
No interview. The AI reads what it already knows from your workspace files plus industry best practices. Proposes a structure. You approve or adjust. Then it builds.

**Option C - Audit / Resume Mode**
For people who already have a workforce set up. Scans what exists, finds gaps, fills them without overwriting anything. Also resumes an interrupted interview.

## The Act As If Protocol

When a persona is selected for a task, the instruction is:

**"Act as if you are [persona name] executing this task."**

This means BECOME that person for the duration of the task. Their beliefs, standards, voice, approach, quirks. The agent asks itself: "How would this person do this?" and that's how it executes.

Personas are selected PER TASK, not per role. The same Marketing Director might use Seth Godin for content strategy, Gary Vee for social media, and Alex Hormozi for a lead magnet. The persona follows the work, not the worker.

## 5-Layer Persona Alignment

Before selecting a persona for any task:

1. **Company Mission** - Does this persona align with the company's mission?
2. **Owner Values** - Does this persona match the owner's personal beliefs and style?
3. **Company Goals/KPIs** - Does this persona support what the company is trying to achieve?
4. **Department Goals/KPIs** - Does this persona fit this department's objectives?
5. **Task Fit** - Is this persona the right guide for THIS specific task?

Layers 1-2 run once at setup (pre-qualified pool). Layers 3-5 run fresh every task.

## Workspace Architecture

### What Every Department Gets

**Unique files (created new):**
- SOUL.md - generated from interview answers, specific to this department
- MEMORY.md - empty, ready for use
- HEARTBEAT.md - department-specific starting priorities
- memory/ folder - for daily session logs

**Inherited files (copied from main CEO workspace):**
- TOOLS.md - same tools, same credentials
- AGENTS.md - same behavioral playbook
- USER.md - same human, same preferences

### What Gets Added to openclaw.json
Each department head gets an agents.list entry:
- id: "dept-[name]"
- name: "[Department] Director"
- workspace: full path to department folder
- model: assigned based on department complexity

## Interview Design

### Before Asking Any Question
Check USER.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and workforce-interview-answers.md for information already known. Confirm instead of re-asking.

### Question Philosophy
- Plain English only. No jargon.
- Every question includes an example answer
- After every question: "If you are not sure, just tell me to research it."
- Dynamic count: 3-7 per department based on complexity and what is already known
- Progress indicators at milestones
- Flush after every answered question (resume capability)

### Handoff File
Created immediately when interview starts. Updated after every question. Stored at company-discovery/interview-handoff.md. Enables resume from any point.

## Devil's Advocate (Auto-Created)

After all departments are set up, the AI automatically creates a Devil's Advocate in every department. The client is NOT asked about this. The DA:
- Challenges department claims with evidence and data
- Compares current performance to historical peaks
- Has a 72-hour response window before escalating to the CEO feed
- Gets a unique set of challenge questions based on that department's KPIs

**The DA uses the Act As If Protocol.** Each challenge the DA makes, it selects a persona through the same 5-layer alignment. A DA reviewing marketing might operate as Jim Collins ("Is this good enough, or is it good to great?"). A DA reviewing finances might operate as Mike Michalowicz ("Where is the profit?"). Different challenges, different personas, different angles. This prevents the DA from becoming a one-trick mechanical critic.

The CEO gets a plain-English explanation: "Your AI workforce includes a quality checker in every department. Its job is to make sure your team is actually delivering results, not just saying they are."

## Example: Completed Department Workspace

After Skill 23 finishes, a Marketing department workspace looks like this:

~/clawd/departments/marketing/
- SOUL.md (unique - Marketing Director identity, generated from interview)
- MEMORY.md (unique - empty, ready for use)
- HEARTBEAT.md (unique - department priorities from interview)
- TOOLS.md (inherited from main workspace)
- AGENTS.md (inherited from main workspace)
- USER.md (inherited from main workspace)
- memory/ (folder for daily logs)
- governing-personas.md (pre-qualified persona pool for marketing tasks)
- devils-advocate/ (DA config and challenge questions)

If a specialist was determined to be full-time (e.g., Social Media Manager):
~/clawd/departments/marketing/specialists/social-media-manager/
- SOUL.md (unique - generated from interview, reflects what the client said about social media)
- MEMORY.md (unique - tracks campaigns run, engagement data, brand voice decisions)
- agents.list entry in openclaw.json (makes it a permanent team member that survives restarts)

If a specialist was determined to be on-call (e.g., one-time logo design):
~/clawd/subagents/templates/logo-designer/
- SOUL.md (task template only - no persistent memory, spawned by department head when needed)

## Config Safety

Before ANY edit to openclaw.json:
1. Backup to ~/Downloads/openclaw-backups/ with human-readable name
2. Make the edit
3. Validate JSON
4. Verify backup is in the right location (not a hidden folder)
5. If backup is in wrong place, re-backup to correct location

## What This Skill Replaced

This skill consolidates what were previously three separate skills:
- **Former Skill 33 (Department Heads)** - workspace creation, SOUL.md generation, agents.list entries
- **Former Skill 34 (Intelligent Staffing)** - specialist determination (permanent vs on-call)
- Both are now archived as 33-department-heads-ARCHIVED and 34-intelligent-staffing-ARCHIVED

## Connection to Skill 22 (Book-to-Persona Coaching Leadership System)

Skill 22 must be installed first. Skill 23 checks for the coaching-personas Gemini Vector Database before proceeding.

If Skill 22 is installed: personas are assigned during setup using the Act As If Protocol and 5-layer alignment.
If Skill 22 is NOT installed: structure builds clean. Install Skill 22 later and re-run in Option C to wire personas in.
