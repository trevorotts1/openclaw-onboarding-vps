Create / augment role-level workspaces inside a department.

v10.6.1 (Wave 5b) changes:
  - Renamed from create-role-workspaces.py (hyphens are not valid in Python
    import names — Wave 4's import was broken).
  - Added augment_role_folder() and augment_all_existing_role_folders() —
    these were referenced by post-build-role-workspaces.py since Wave 4 but
    never actually written.
  - Added library template-fill: when creating a role's how-to.md, check
    templates/role-library/_index.json for a matching pre-written doc. If
    one exists, read it from templates/role-library/[dept]/[slug].md, fill
    company-specific tokens, and use that instead of the stub. Falls back
    to the stub when no library match.

Per-role workspace layout:
    [DEPT]/[role-slug]/

    ├── SOUL.md             (unique, with Persona Governance Override clause)

## Persona Governance Override

When you are assigned a persona for a task, that persona governs HOW you perform
the work. Your beliefs, voice, decision logic, quality bar, and judgment for that
task come from the persona — not from this file.

Act AS IF you ARE the persona for the duration of the task. Use their frameworks.
Use their phrasing. Hold their standards. Make the calls they would make.

This file is your fallback identity. It governs only when no persona is assigned.
When a persona is present, this file is subordinate to it.

**Order of operations:**
1. Check for an assigned persona. If present → act AS that persona.
2. If no persona is assigned → use this file.
3. In all cases: honor the company's mission (workspace SOUL.md) and the owner's
   stated values (workspace USER.md).
"""

CEO_DEFERRAL = """
## Persona Governance — CEO Mode

As the CEO / Master Orchestrator, you do NOT fully defer to assigned personas.
You use them as INPUT, but you remain accountable to the company's mission and
the owner's values at all times — those override the persona when there is conflict.

When a persona is assigned to a CEO-level task:
1. Read the persona's frameworks, voice, and decision logic. Consider them.
2. Compare to mission (workspace SOUL.md) and owner profile (workspace USER.md).
3. Where the persona ALIGNS → embody it for the task.
4. Where the persona CONFLICTS → mission and owner WIN. Log conflict in MEMORY.md.
5. Your own identity governs when no persona is assigned.

You are the protector of the mission. Personas are tools you use, not authorities
you serve.

   `SOP/` indexed by `SOP/00-INDEX.md` that covers this task. Read it FIRST.
3. Execute the SOP step by step. Do not improvise around it.

2. Hand the task to the department director, OR spawn a sub-agent directly and

   `SOUL.md` -> `how-to.md`, then consult the department-level
   `governing-personas.md` (one level up, in the department folder), then

This folder contains the standard operating procedures the {role_name} uses
to perform their job. The role's `how-to.md` (one level up) is the entry
point and references this folder.

## How this folder works

- **00-INDEX.md** (this file) — table of contents for the SOPs in this folder.
- **NN-<topic>.md** — individual SOPs, numbered in execution order where order matters.
  Examples:
    01-daily-startup.md
    02-task-intake.md
    03-quality-check.md
    99-escalation-protocol.md
- **_assets/** (optional) — supporting files referenced by SOPs (templates, screenshots, prompts).

## Conventions

- Each SOP is one focused procedure. Don't bury 5 procedures in one doc.
- Each SOP starts with: Purpose, Inputs, Steps, Outputs, Escalation.
- SOPs are READ-FIRST: the role MUST read the relevant SOP before executing
  a task it covers. No improvising.
- When a persona is assigned for a task (see workspace-level `governing-personas.md`),
  the persona governs HOW the role executes the SOP — but the SOP's WHAT remains
  the canonical procedure.

## Populating this folder

Initially this folder may contain only this index. SOPs are added incrementally:
- By the role itself as it accumulates work (the role writes its own SOPs)
- By the `populate-sops-from-manifest.py` script when a role-library manifest exists for this department
- By the Master Orchestrator dispatching a "write SOP" task during onboarding for high-priority procedures

When a new SOP is added, append a line to the table below.

## Current SOPs

| # | File | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 00 | 00-INDEX.md | This index |

(Add new SOPs as rows above as they're authored.)

## What this file is

A REFERENCE GUIDE — not a static assignment. The persona-selector picks the
governing persona per task at runtime using the 5-layer scoring matrix
(mission / owner_values / company_kpis / dept_kpis / task_fit).

This file lists personas that have been **pre-qualified** for this department's
work based on their domain alignment. The selector treats this list as a
recommendation pool, but it can still pick from outside the pool when the
task context warrants it.

## Pre-qualified personas

{persona_list_text}

## How selection works

For every task assigned to this department:

1. The director (or dispatching agent) calls `persona-selector-v2.py --task "..." --department {dept_id}`
2. The selector pre-qualifies personas using Layers 1+2 (company mission +
   owner values fit)
3. It scores remaining candidates on Layers 3-5 (company KPIs / dept KPIs /
   task fit via semantic similarity)
4. The top-scoring persona is selected and the assignment is logged to
   `persona-selection-log.md` + `persona_assignment` DB
5. The role-based agent adopts that persona for the duration of the task
6. On task completion, `record-task-completion` runs the adherence verifier
   and writes back to `persona_assignment.verification_json`

## Anti-staleness

If the same persona is selected ≥5 times in a row for the same (department,
task_category) without a switch, `persona_assignment.needs_review` flips to 1.
Surface that on the dashboard and review whether the stickiness is genuine.

## Updating this file

This file is regenerated every time `create_role_workspaces.py` is run
against the department. Edit `persona-categories.json` (or run Skill 22 to
add more personas) and re-run the workspace builder.
