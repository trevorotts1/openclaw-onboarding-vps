AI Workforce Blueprint - Interview Engine & Workspace Builder
Version: 2.0.0
Date: March 22, 2026

This is the core engine for Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint).
It handles:
1. Option A/B/C selection (ALWAYS presented, never skipped)
2. Dynamic interview (3-7 questions per department, plain English)
3. Department workspace creation with core file inheritance
4. Specialist determination (permanent vs on-call, decided by AI silently)
5. Persona alignment using the Act As If Protocol and 5-layer check
6. ORG-CHART.md generation
7. Devil's Advocate auto-creation per department
8. Command Center departments.json generation
9. Flush after every question (resume capability via handoff file)
10. Config safety (backup before edits, validate JSON after)

IMPORTANT:
- This script is executed BY the AI agent, not run directly by the client
- The AI reads this file to understand the interview flow and executes it conversationally
- Questions are generated dynamically based on industry and context, not from a static list
- The AI MUST be running on a high reasoning model (Opus, Sonnet, MiMo V2 Pro, Gemini 3.1 Pro, GPT 5.4)
- Research best practices uses openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro-search

FORBIDDEN CLIENT-FACING LANGUAGE:
- Never say: SOPs, handoffs, tech stack, permanent agent, sub-agent, agent
- Instead say: step-by-step instructions, what departments share, tools you use, team member, specialist, director

    FLOW:

    2. ALWAYS present Option A/B/C (never skip)
    3. If Option A: run dynamic interview
    4. If Option B: read existing files, propose structure, get approval
    5. If Option C: scan existing structure, find gaps, fill them
    6. Create department workspaces with full core files
    7. Determine specialists (permanent vs on-call) silently
    8. Run persona alignment (Act As If Protocol, 5-layer check)
    9. Generate ORG-CHART.md
    10. Generate Command Center departments.json
    11. Create Devil's Advocate per department
    12. Update openclaw.json (backup first, validate after)
    13. Report completion with summary

    INTERVIEW RULES:

    - Plain English only, no jargon
    - Check existing files before asking
    - Confirm known info: "We already know X. Still correct?"
    - Offer research: "Not sure? I can research best practices for your industry."

    - Update handoff file after every answer
    - Progress indicators at milestones

    AI WORKFORCE BLUEPRINT - COMPANY SETUP
    ==============================================

    Welcome! I'm going to help you set up your AI company.

    You have three options:

    Option A - Full Interview (Recommended)
    I'll ask you about your business and build everything
    based on your answers. Most personalized results.

    Option B - Quick Setup
    I'll use what I already know about you plus industry
    best practices. You review and adjust. Fastest path.

    Option C - Audit / Resume
    If you already have a workforce set up, or if we
    got interrupted last time, I'll pick up where we left off.

    Which option would you like?
