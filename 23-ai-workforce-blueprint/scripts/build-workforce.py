AI Workforce Blueprint - Interview Engine & Workspace Builder
Version: 2.1.0
Date: March 22, 2026

TIMEOUT OVERRIDE:
For complex businesses with many departments, the full workforce build
(interview + workspace creation + persona wiring + config updates) can take
significant time. The recommended sub-agent timeout is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
Set this when spawning the build agent to avoid premature termination on
large builds with 8+ departments and full knowledge base content generation.

This is the core engine for Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint).
It handles:
1. Option A/B/C selection (ALWAYS presented, never skipped)
2. Dynamic interview (3-7 questions per department, plain English)
3. Department workspace creation with core file inheritance
4. Specialist determination (permanent vs on-call, decided by AI silently)
5. Persona alignment using the Act As If Protocol and 5-layer check
6. ORG-CHART.md generation
7. Devil's Advocate auto-creation per department (SOUL.md + SOP.md)
8. Command Center departments.json generation
9. Flush after every question (resume capability via handoff file)
10. Config safety (backup before edits, validate JSON after)

NON-INTERACTIVE MODE:
- Pass --non-interactive to read all config from a JSON file instead of prompting
- Use --config-file to specify the JSON config path (default: workforce-config.json)
- This is required when running via AI agent that cannot handle interactive prompts

IMPORTANT:
- This script is executed BY the AI agent, not run directly by the client
- The AI reads this file to understand the interview flow and executes it conversationally
- Questions are generated dynamically based on industry and context, not from a static list
- The AI MUST be running on a high reasoning model (Opus, Sonnet, MiMo V2 Pro, Gemini 3.1 Pro, GPT 5.4)
- Research best practices uses openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro-search

FORBIDDEN CLIENT-FACING LANGUAGE:
- Never say: SOPs, handoffs, tech stack, permanent agent, sub-agent, agent
- Instead say: step-by-step instructions, what departments share, tools you use, team member, specialist, director

    WS-4 (23-DEPT STANDARD): auto-add vertical-pack departments to the workforce.

    Standard set (the 16 canonical floor) is already applied by
    reconcile_canonical_floor(). This sibling step adds the 7 universal primary
    vertical departments (one per pack) PLUS keyword-matched extras:

      PHASE 1 — UNIVERSAL PRIMARIES (23-dept floor, fires for ALL clients):
        Every vertical pack exposes exactly one universal_primary department
        (marked universal_primary=true in department-naming-map.json; defaults to
        the first dept in the pack if the flag is absent). These 7 departments are
        added to EVERY client regardless of industry — giving 16+7=23 as the
        minimum floor. Industry matching does NOT gate these.

      PHASE 2 — KEYWORD-MATCHED EXTRAS (flavor on top of the 23 floor):
        Detect which packs match the client's industry/business context via
        auto_add_keywords. For each matching pack, add remaining (non-universal-
        primary) departments to selected_departments. These extras are ADDITIVE
        and do NOT reduce the floor — they push the final count to 23+.

      DE-DUP: all adds are de-duped against (a) the canonical floor under any
        canonical id/alias/variant, (b) a prior universal-primary already added,
        and (c) any dept already added in THIS pass.

      Each added department inherits its base_suggested_roles file so it ships
      with real roles + SOPs (never hard-fails assert_dept_map_resolves).

      Write a McKinsey-style industry-org-design research manifest and an
      auditable verticalPacks record into build-state.

# Best-effort: if OPENROUTER_API_KEY is missing or the network is down, the
# function returns None and the caller falls back to its existing default
# (per N15 web-research pre-flight already lands authoritative defaults in
# preflight-research.json).

## ⛔ PRIME DIRECTIVE — I AM A TASK ROUTER. I ROUTE. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.

1. I am the master orchestrator (CEO). My one job is to ROUTE tasks. When any task or request
   reaches me, I ROUTE it to the correct DEPARTMENT — every time. I have NO permission to decide
   not to route, to refuse a task, or to choose what I will or will not do.
2. I do NOT do the work myself, and I do NOT pick the specialist or spawn/keep control of a
   sub-agent to do it. I route to the DEPARTMENT. The DEPARTMENT decides which specialist
   sub-agent and which persona are needed; the task gets a persona assigned; the task is placed
   on the Kanban board. The doing belongs to the department and its specialist — never to me.
3. Before I would EVER do a task myself, I must FIRST seek and RECEIVE explicit permission and
   consent from the owner (the human in control). Without that explicit consent, I route — always.
   (Routing is my default and is always allowed; I never need permission to route.)
4. If I cannot determine the right department, I route to the General Tasks department. I never
   self-execute because I'm unsure, and I never hold a task to "stay in control" of it.
5. What I MAY do: have conversations, manage agents, manage departments, and route tasks.
   What I may NEVER do: refuse to route, decide who executes, execute the work myself, or
   commandeer a sub-agent to keep control.

### Routing = Creating a DEPARTMENT TASK (not spawning a sub-agent directly)

The correct routing action is POST to `/api/tasks/ingest` with `department_slug: "<slug>"`.
This places the task on the department's Kanban — the DEPARTMENT assigns the specialist.

Spawning a sub-agent and instructing it to execute production work IS THE SAME VIOLATION as
executing the work yourself. If a sub-agent is spawned, it MUST read its own role files and
operate via the task board — it is not a production tool for the orchestrator.

### Binding Rules

- **R1** Never generate images, videos, audio, or written deliverables
- **R2** Never write to files, databases, or external APIs as a production action
- **R3** Never use any skill that produces a deliverable (`skills: []` enforced in config)
- **R4** Every actionable request → `POST /api/tasks/ingest` with `department_slug`
- **R5** If CC unreachable → escalate via Telegram, do NOT execute directly
- **R6** If route is unclear → use `department_slug: "general-task"`, never self-execute
- **R7** Permitted actions only: Telegram messaging, task-ingest POST, read workspace files, gateway restart

# READ-THE-SOP OPERATING PROTOCOL (canonical, embedded in every agent)
# ============================================================
# The wiring gap this closes: nothing previously told a director (or a spawned
# specialist sub-agent) to READ its role folder BEFORE working. The read-first
# rule lived only in the shared AGENTS.md + INSTRUCTIONS.md prose, so an agent
# that skipped AGENTS.md had no read-the-SOP directive in its OWN first-read
# files. DIRECTOR_OPERATING_PROTOCOL below is written verbatim into the
# director's IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md (generate_identity_md/generate_soul_md), so the
# protocol is present in the files the agent reads first — not dependent on the
# shared AGENTS.md being installed. The CEO / Master Orchestrator variant lives
# in create_role_workspaces.py (CEO_OPERATING_PROTOCOL there is the single source
# of truth, embedded by stub_identity/stub_soul via post-build-role-workspaces.py).

DIRECTOR_OPERATING_PROTOCOL = """## Operating Protocol — Read the SOP Before You Work (binding)

Before executing ANY task, follow these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip a step.

1. **Pick the right specialist.** Consult this department's `ROSTER.md` (the
   When-to Reference Map for this department) to choose the specialist role
   whose when-to-use line matches the task. If no role matches, escalate to the
   CEO / Master Orchestrator rather than guessing.
2. **Spawn a sub-agent and have it FULLY ADOPT the role.** Spawn an OpenClaw
   sub-agent and instruct it to read the chosen role folder's files IN ORDER:
   `00-START-HERE.md` -> `IDENTITY.md` -> `SOUL.md` -> `how-to.md` (the SOPs)
   -> `governing-personas.md`. The sub-agent acts AS IF it IS that role for the
   duration of the task and executes per the how-to (its Section-9 SOPs / the
   matching `SOP/` file indexed by `SOP/00-INDEX.md`).
3. **No procedure, no guessing.** If the role folder has no SOP/how-to that
   covers the task, do NOT let the sub-agent proceed by guessing — fire the
   department SOP-Writer (INSTRUCTIONS.md Moment 3.7) to author the missing SOP
   first, or escalate.
4. **Review against the how-to before reporting.** When the sub-agent returns,
   review its output against the same how-to/SOP it was supposed to follow.
   Only then report results upward.

# ROLE WORKSPACE CREATION (Phase: post-department, pre-specialist)
# ============================================================

# ============================================================
# DEPT -> SUGGESTED-ROLES FILE MAP (canonical, single-source-of-truth)
# ============================================================
# v10.15.18 BUG FIX (zero-role-department): the previous hardcoded map keyed
# on LEGACY ids (support/operations/creative/hr/it) that DO NOT match the
# canonical 16-dept folder ids (customer-support/crm/graphics/openclaw-
# maintenance/...), and several of its files (operations-/creative-/hr-people-/
# it-tech-suggested-roles.md) DO NOT EXIST in the repo. For any dept that
# resolved through a missing/mismatched entry, role parsing silently warned
# and produced ZERO roles -> ZERO SOPs for that whole department. That is one
# of the documented variance drivers (whole departments at ~0).
#
# THE FIX: derive the map from department-naming-map.json (the SAME source of
# truth load_canonical_floor() uses), so the canonical ids ALWAYS resolve to a
# real file. We also keep the legacy ids as aliases (for any client whose
# departments.json still stores a legacy slug). build_dept_to_suggested_roles()
# is the canonical builder; LEGACY_DEPT_ALIASES bridges old slugs.

# Legacy slug -> the suggested-roles filename it should resolve to. These are
# ONLY for backward compatibility with old departments.json files; canonical
# ids come from the naming map. (creative/operations/hr/it intentionally map to
# the closest real file so a stale slug never yields zero roles.)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

> **TODO:** This SOP needs to be populated with industry-specific best practices.
> The AI agent should research best practices using Perplexity and personalize
> these steps using the client's interview answers (tools, KPIs, challenges).
>
> **Interview context:**
> - Industry: {industry}
> - Department challenges: {department_challenges if department_challenges else 'Not specified'}
> - Department tools: {department_tools if department_tools else 'Not specified'}
> - Department KPIs: {department_kpis if department_kpis else 'Not specified'}

2. [Step 2 - to be personalized based on research]
3. [Step 3 - to be personalized based on research]

## What to Do If Something Goes Wrong
- Check department SOUL.md for escalation procedures
- Report to the department head
- Log the issue in the department memory/ folder

## Escalation
If this task cannot be completed at the specialist level, escalate to the {dept_info['head']}.

LEAN_SIX_SIGMA_SOP_PROMPT = """
You are writing real, AI-facing SOPs for the {DEPT_NAME} department of {COMPANY_NAME} (industry: {INDUSTRY}).

You have ONE department's worth of SOP stub files to populate. Each stub currently has placeholder steps like '[Step 1 - to be personalized based on research]'. Your job is to REPLACE those placeholders with real, executable steps the AI agent will follow.

Use the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC structure for every SOP. Every SOP file must contain these sections:

  ## DEFINE
  - What this task is in one sentence
  - Required inputs (data, files, credentials, prior outputs)
  - Required outputs (the artifact this task produces)
  - Done criteria — MEASURABLE, not vague. e.g. 'Email scheduled, subject line A/B tested, segment confirmed'

  ## MEASURE
  - KPIs this task moves. Numbers, not adjectives.
  - How those KPIs map to the department KPIs: {DEPT_KPIS}
  - How department KPIs roll up to company KPIs.

  ## ANALYZE (when the task underperforms)
  - Root-cause checklist. Five Whys. Not symptom-chasing.
  - Common failure modes specific to this industry: research them via Perplexity.

  ## IMPROVE — Step-by-Step
  - Numbered concrete steps. Each step references a specific tool from: {DEPT_TOOLS}
  - Each step is something an AI agent can ACTUALLY do (read file X, call API Y, post to channel Z).
  - Embody the role's persona expertise. If the persona is John Maxwell for a leadership role, use Maxwell's principles verbatim where applicable.

  ## CONTROL
  - Devil's Advocate checkpoints. What the DA verifies before declaring done.
  - The DA must validate measurable criteria from DEFINE, not subjective taste.

  ## ESCALATION + RESEARCH RULE (binding — paste this section verbatim into every SOP)
  If you hit an edge case not covered above:
    - DO NOT GUESS. Guessing is forbidden for any AI employee.
    - You are either ABSOLUTELY SURE of the next step (proceed) or you are NOT SURE (research).
    - If not sure: run Perplexity research (`openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro-search`) with a specific query, OR escalate to the {DEPT_HEAD}.
    - Document the edge case AND the research outcome in {DEPT_DIR}/memory/[YYYY-MM-DD].md.

Hard constraints:
  - NEVER reference Anthropic models. Use the selector chain heavy tier when invoking models.
  - Plain English. No corporate jargon.
  - Tools referenced must be from {DEPT_TOOLS}. If a useful tool is missing from that list, recommend it under a 'Suggested tool additions' section at the bottom — don't pretend it's available.
  - Cite Perplexity research findings inline when a step is derived from research. e.g. 'Per industry benchmark (Perplexity 2026-05-13): companies in {INDUSTRY} typically...'

For each role folder in this department, you'll find:
  - 00-START-HERE.md (DO NOT rewrite — already contains role context)
  - governing-personas.md (DO NOT rewrite — already lists persona traits)
  - 01-, 02-, 03-, etc. SOP files (THESE are what you populate)
  - tools.md, good-examples.md, bad-examples.md (write these if missing)

When you write an SOP, keep the file's existing top metadata (Role, Department, Company, Industry, Version, Date). Replace ONLY the body sections (Purpose, Who This Is For, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, What to Do If Something Goes Wrong, Escalation) with the DMAIC-structured content above.

Output: rewrite each SOP file in place. Report back with a list of files written, line count per file, and any edge cases you flagged for owner attention.

## Department-to-Persona Mapping for 5-Layer Matching

**Generated:** {datetime.now().strftime('%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p')}
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

This matrix maps each department to its pre-qualified persona pool (Layers 1-2 of the 5-layer matching protocol).
Personas listed here have passed company mission and owner alignment checks.

**How to use:**
1. For each task, query the personas listed for that department
2. Apply Layers 3-5 (company goals, department goals, task fit) to select the best match
3. Log selection in persona-selection-log.md

### Step 1: Pre-Qualification (Layers 1-2)
Personas in this matrix have already been validated against:
- Company mission alignment
- Owner values and style alignment

### Step 2: Per-Task Matching (Layers 3-5)
For each task, score candidates on:
- Layer 3: Company goals/KPIs alignment
- Layer 4: Department goals/KPIs alignment
- Layer 5: Task-specific fit

### Step 3: Selection and Logging
After selecting a persona, log it:
```
[date] [task-id] "candidates" "selected" "layer-3-reason" "layer-4-reason" "layer-5-reason"
```

---

## Updating This Matrix

This matrix is auto-generated by build-workforce.py whenever the workforce is built.
To regenerate after adding new personas (via Skill 22):
1. Re-run build-workforce.py, or
2. Manually run: `python3 build-workforce.py --non-interactive --config-file workforce-config.json`

    AI WORKFORCE BLUEPRINT - COMPANY SETUP
    ==============================================

    Welcome! I'm going to help you set up your AI company.

    You have three options:

    Option A - Full Interview (Recommended)
    I'll ask you about your business and build everything
    based on your answers. Most personalized results.

    Option B - Quick Setup
    I'll use what I already know about you plus industry
    best practices. You review and adjust. Fastest path.

    Option C - Audit / Resume
    If you already have a workforce set up, or if we
    got interrupted last time, I'll pick up where we left off.

    Which option would you like?

    # The AI agent handles the response conversationally from here.
    # The functions above provide the building blocks.
    # The AI uses:
    #   - log_answer() after every question
    #   - create_handoff() after every answer
    #   - create_department_workspace() for each department
    #   - determine_specialists() for specialist decisions
    #   - create_governing_personas_md() for persona wiring
    #   - generate_org_chart() at the end
    #   - generate_departments_json() for the Command Center
    #   - add_agent_to_config() for each department head
    #   - backup_config() before ANY config edits
    #   - save_openclaw_config() with validation after edits
