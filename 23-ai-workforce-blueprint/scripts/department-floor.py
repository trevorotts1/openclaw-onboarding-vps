department-floor.py — the ONE source of truth for the HARD department floor.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the bug it kills):
Clients kept landing with HEAVILY-REDUCED workforces (Cassandra 3 depts, others
3-per-dept / 6-dept / legacy) DESPITE the repo carrying 216 role templates, 16
mandatory canonical departments, and 7 industry vertical packs. Diagnosis found
THREE places that trusted the build-state JSON as proof of completion instead of
counting REAL departments on disk:
  1. verify-zhc-standard.sh step-2 read `.departments[]` from the build-state
     JSON, so a hand-seeded 3-dept JSON (Cassandra's seeded fiction) reported
     "all canonical present" and passed the floor.
  2. qc-completeness.sh measured per-dept staffing of whatever was ON DISK but
     had NO floor concept at all — 3 well-staffed depts returned PASS.
  3. run-closeout.sh / resume-workforce-build.sh self-completed on JSON
     status=done / closeoutStatus=done with zero disk verification.

THE FIX (this module): compute the EXPECTED floor =
    16 mandatory canonical departments
    + the 7 universal primary vertical-pack departments (one per pack,
      marked universal_primary=true in department-naming-map.json — these
      fire for EVERY client regardless of industry, giving the 7-universal-primary floor)
    + 2 new mandatory depts (general-task, project-architecture-office) added in v11.1.0
    − any department the client EXPLICITLY declined (recorded as an explicit
      decline in build-state canonicalReconciliation.decisions == "no")

    Industry keyword matching STILL adds additional pack departments on top of
    the 26 floor, but those extras are not gating — the gate only checks for
    the 7 universal primaries (plus the 19 mandatory). The minimum floor is
    26 departments. exit 3 fires when disk is below 26 or a specific
    mandatory/universal-primary dept is missing. Exit 3 never fires for missing
    EXTRA (keyword-matched) pack depts — those are flavor, not floor.

…and then count the REAL department directories ON DISK and FAIL hard when disk
is below the floor or a mandatory/universal-primary dept is missing from disk.
The build-state JSON is NEVER trusted as proof of floor compliance — only disk
is.

Reads the SAME source of truth as build-workforce.py:
    23-ai-workforce-blueprint/department-naming-map.json  (.mandatory + .vertical_packs)

USAGE
  python3 department-floor.py --json            # machine-readable verdict to stdout
  python3 department-floor.py                   # human summary to stderr
EXIT CODES
  0  floor met (on disk >= 26: all mandatory(−declines) + all 7 universal primaries(−declines))
  3  floor NOT met (below 26 or a specific mandatory/universal-primary dept missing)
  7  no workforce / cannot resolve company on disk

This module is import-safe: `from department_floor import evaluate_floor`
(after adding the scripts dir to sys.path) returns the verdict dict directly.
Read-only. Never writes. Idempotent.
