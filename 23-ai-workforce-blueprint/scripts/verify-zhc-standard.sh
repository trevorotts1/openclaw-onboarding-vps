# verify-zhc-standard.sh — v10.16.25
#
# ONE source of truth for "is this Zero-Human Company built to the McDonald's
# standard?" Callable from Skill 23 close AND Skill 37 closeout preflight. It
# asserts the full standard end-to-end so no two clients get different
# experiences and nothing is ever marked "done" on a build-state lie:
#
#   1. INTERVIEW COMPLETE   — build-state interviewComplete==true (or an
#                             answers file with real, non-stub content)
#   2. 16 CANONICAL DEPTS   — every mandatory dept from department-naming-map.json
#                             is present on disk (minus any EXPLICITLY declined)
#   3. ROLE LIBRARY DONE     — roleLibraryStatus==done: every dept meets its
#                             canonical role count AND how-to.md filled
#   4. SOP LIBRARY DONE      — sopLibraryStatus==done: every role has >= its
#                             substantive-SOP floor (>=7KB + DMAIC + no stub)
#   5. CLOSEOUT CONFIRMED    — closeoutStatus in {done,sent} AND at least one
#                             telegram message actually delivered
#
# This script does NOT fix anything — it MEASURES and reports. It delegates the
# library verdicts to verify-library-gate.sh (the disk-QC authority) so there
# is exactly one substance definition. Read-only except for the gate's state
# write. Idempotent. Safe to re-run.
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 = FULL STANDARD MET (build may close out / closeout may finalize)
#   2 = interview incomplete
#   3 = department floor not met ON DISK (missing mandatory or matched-vertical
#       depts — measured by department-floor.py against real folders, NOT the
#       build-state JSON; closeout MUST refuse on this code)
#   4 = role library not done
#   5 = SOP library not done
#   6 = closeout not confirmed
#   7 = no workforce / cannot resolve company
#
# Multiple gaps => the LOWEST-numbered gap is reported as the exit code, but ALL
# gaps are printed so the operator/agent sees the whole picture in one run.

# industry-matched vertical-pack departments are not present as real folders.
# The ONLY way to be below the mandatory floor is an EXPLICIT recorded decline
