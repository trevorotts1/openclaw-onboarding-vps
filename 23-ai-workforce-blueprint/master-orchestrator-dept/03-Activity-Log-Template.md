## QMD Embed Schedule

- Current day's log: NEVER embedded mid-day (still being written)
- Previous day's log: Embedded every morning at day start
- Commands: `qmd update` then `qmd embed`
- Annual archive: Move completed year to `daily-company-logs/archive/YYYY/` and QMD embed the archive

---

## Log Retention Policy

- Current year: All logs stay in `daily-company-logs/`
- End of year: Move full year to `daily-company-logs/archive/YYYY/` and QMD embed
- Never auto-delete: Archiving only. Deletion is the owner's decision.
- Logs are searchable via QMD after embedding
