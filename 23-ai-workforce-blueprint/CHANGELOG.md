## [v10.6.2] — 2026-05-19 — Role Library Version Realigned + verify-role-library.sh

### Added
- `scripts/verify-role-library.sh` — 7-check sanity script for the role library on disk. Was referenced from the QC summary "next step" line but never existed until now. Use:
  ```bash
  bash 23-ai-workforce-blueprint/scripts/verify-role-library.sh
  # or
  bash 23-ai-workforce-blueprint/scripts/verify-role-library.sh --skill-dir /path/to/skill
  bash 23-ai-workforce-blueprint/scripts/verify-role-library.sh --json
  ```

### Updated
- `skill-version.txt` → `10.6.2` (was `10.6.1`)
- `templates/role-library/_index.json` `"version"` → `"10.6.2"` (was `"10.6.0"` — stale since the role library merge)
- `templates/role-library/_index.json` `generated_at` refreshed
- `templates/role-library/_qc-summary.md` heading → `Role Library v10.6.2` (was `v10.6.0`)

### Why these were stale
The Wave 5b commit (v10.6.1) only touched `/version` and `/skill-version.txt`. The library files were left at their original v10.6.0 generation values. Repo-wide drift-prevention (`scripts/bump-version.sh` + `.github/workflows/version-consistency.yml`) was added in this same release to prevent recurrence — see root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [v10.6.1] — 2026-05-19 — Wave 5b: Library Template-Fill

### Added
- `scripts/create_role_workspaces.py` — replaces `create-role-workspaces.py` (deleted)
  - New: `library_lookup(role_slug, dept_slug)` — reads `templates/role-library/_index.json` for matching role
  - New: `try_library_fill(role_name, dept_path, is_ceo)` — orchestrates lookup + token-fill, returns filled content or None
  - New: `fill_tokens(content, role_name, dept_name, is_ceo)` — substitutes `{{COMPANY_NAME}}`, revenue cascade tokens (`{{YEARLY_GOAL}}` → cascade ÷4 ÷12 ÷52 ÷250), `{{INDUSTRY_VERTICAL}}`, `{{ROLE_TITLE}}`, `{{DEPARTMENT_NAME}}`, `{{DIRECTOR_OR_MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR}}`, `{{ISO_DATE}}`, `{{ASSIGNED_PERSONA}}`
  - New: `augment_role_folder(role_path, workspace_root)` — idempotent v2.1 file augmentation (previously referenced by post-build, never defined — Wave 4 bug)
  - New: `augment_all_existing_role_folders(dept_path, workspace_root, dry_run)` — walks a dept and augments each role folder (Wave 4 bug fix)
- `create_role_workspace()` now uses library template-fill for `how-to.md` when a match exists; falls back to `stub_how_to()` when no match

### Behavior change for `build-workforce.py`
When `build-workforce.py` finishes a dept build, the post-build hook (in place since Wave 4) now actually works — and where the v10.6.0 library has a matching role doc, the role's `how-to.md` is template-filled from the library instead of left as a stub awaiting a fresh sub-agent generation.

Estimated time-per-role on a typical build: ~3 min (template-fill) vs ~15 min (sub-agent fresh write). With ~210 of 216 library matches across the 16 mandatory depts, a typical build drops from ~3 hours to ~30-45 minutes of role-doc work.

### Removed
- `scripts/create-role-workspaces.py` (hyphen-named — Python could not import it as `create_role_workspaces`)

### Library header stamp
Every doc filled from the library carries a header comment so QC/owner can identify provenance:
```
<!-- Filled from role-library v10.6.0 on YYYY-MM-DD -->
```

---

## [v10.6.0] — 2026-05-19 — Role Library Production (216 PASS docs)

Backfilled. The 216-doc role library was merged to main via `role-library-v10.6.0` branch. The library lives at `templates/role-library/[dept]/[role-slug].md` with an `_index.json` registry.

Library is dormant at v10.6.0 — nothing reads from it. v10.6.1 (Wave 5b) wires it into role workspace creation.

---

## [v10.5.2] — 2026-05-17 — Wave 4.5: Specialist Coverage Expansion

Every mandatory department now has the role roster needed to operate at Fortune-500 scale. Brings 12 pre-v2.1 department files up to the v2.1 baseline (added missing QC + Deep Research roles to depts that had them only conceptually) AND adds 70 new specialist roles across 16 departments.

### What changed per department

| Department | Pre-Wave-4.5 specialists | Post-Wave-4.5 specialists | Net change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Marketing | 4 → | 11 (Brand Positioning, Content Strategist, Content Marketing, Funnel, Customer Journey, Influencer, Marketing Analytics, Lead Magnet, Webinar/Event, Email Campaign, Affiliate) | +7 |
| Sales | 4 → | 11 (SDR, Appointment Setter, Discovery, Closer, AE Full-Cycle, Account Manager, Proposal, Follow-up, Sales Ops, CRM-Sales, +1 deep research) | +7 |
| Billing & Finance | 3 → | 9 (Invoicing/AR, Subscription, Bookkeeping, Cash Flow, FP&A, Collections, Financial Reporting, Tax Liaison, CRM-Billing) | +6 |
| Customer Support | 3 → | 11 (Tier 1/2, Refunds, Onboarding, Retention, KB, Live Chat, Voice, Account Health, Churn Prevention) | +8 |
| Web Development | 3 → | 12 (Funnel, Landing Page, SEO, Tech SEO, Web Designer, Frontend/JS/React, CRO, WordPress, Member Area, A11y, Web Security) | +9 |
| App Development | 3 → | 11 (Desktop, iOS, Android, PWA, API/Backend, UX/UI, Cloud Infra, ASO, App Analytics, QA Tester) | +8 |
| Graphics | 5 → | 12 (AI Image Gen, Brand Identity, Social Media Graphics, Ad Creative, Presentation Designer, Course Slides, Book Cover, Infographic, Email Designer, Print, Thumbnail) | +7 |
| Video | 5 → | 13 (Storyboard, Long-form, Short-form, AI Video Gen, Editor, Video SEO, VSL, Motion Graphics, Animation, Color Grading, Captioning, Live Streaming, CRM-Video) | +8 |
| Audio | 6 → | 11 (Producer, Editor, AI Voice, Sound Design, Speech Writing, Music, Transcription, Audio Mastering, Audiobook, Voice Agent Builder, CRM-Audio) | +5 |
| Research | 3 → | 7 (Industry Analysis, Competitive Intel, Market Trends, Customer Research, Persona Research, Data Analysis, Survey & Polling) | +4 |
| Communications | 3 → | 10 (PR, Internal Comms, Brand Messaging, Press Release, Crisis Comms, Speech/Talking Points, Media Pitching, Op-Ed Ghostwriter, Investor/Stakeholder, Deep Research) | +7 |
| CRM | 7 → | 7 (already complete in v2.1, no expansion needed) | 0 |
| OpenClaw Maintenance | 6 → | 9 (System Health, Skill Update, Memory Hygiene, Integration/MCP, Backup & Recovery, Security & Secrets, Monitoring/Observability, Performance Tuning, Disaster Recovery) | +3 |
| Legal | 2 → | 10 (Contract Drafter, Customer Agreement, Affiliate Agreement, Employment Contract, Compliance Monitor, Industry-Specific Regulatory, Terms/Privacy, IP/Trademark, Vendor Contract, Dispute Resolution) | +8 |
| Social Media | 10 → | 13 (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Pinterest, YouTube Channel, Threads, Bluesky, Community Manager, Reddit, Quora, Discord) | +3 |
| Paid Advertisement | 12 → | 17 (Google, Bing, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Pinterest, YouTube, Spotify, Snapchat, Native, Cross-Platform Attribution, Retargeting, Creative Testing, Audience Research, Conversion Tracking) | +5 |
| **TOTAL specialists** | **79** | **174** | **+95** |

Plus universal roles (Director + QC + Deep Research per dept = 47 universal) + Master Orchestrator = **~222 total roles in the canonical roster**.

### v2.1 Baseline Brought Forward

Every department now has all 4 universal roles confirmed:
- Director (role #0)
- QC Specialist
- Deep Research Specialist (except Research dept which IS deep research)
- Devil's Advocate (sub-folder, created by `build-workforce.py:create_department_workspace`)

### Calendar Specialist NOT added
Confirmed via owner feedback: clients use GoHighLevel calendar or Google Calendar directly. No Calendly/booking-system specialist needed in Web Development.

### Why this matters for the role library generation (PRD v2.3)
PRD v2.3 estimated 146 docs. With this expansion, the library generation produces **~205 docs** (Master Orchestrator + ~204 mandatory specialists across 16 depts). Adjusts:
- 20 writer sub-agents → still 20 (each writer handles ~10 docs instead of ~7)
- Wall-clock: ~130-150 min instead of ~100-115
- Cost: ~$22-35 (Ollama primary) or ~$110-150 (all OpenRouter)
- Still well within owner's time and budget tolerance

### Versions
- `skill-version.txt`: 10.5.1 → **10.5.2**
- Onboarding root `version`: v10.5.1 → **v10.5.2**

---

## [v10.5.1] — 2026-05-17 — Wave 4: Hand-Touch Integration

### Changed

- **`scripts/build-workforce.py`** — Inline v10.5.1 hook at the end of `build_from_config()`. After all departments and persona matrix are created, spawns `post-build-role-workspaces.py` via subprocess (30s timeout) to augment every role folder with v2.1 files. Wrapped in try/except so failure doesn't break the main build.
- **`scripts/post-build-role-workspaces.py`** — Reworked to AUGMENT existing role folders rather than create duplicates. Detects pre-v2.1 role folders (any naming pattern, with or without numeric prefix) and adds IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, how-to.md stub, and AGENTS/TOOLS/USER symlinks in place. Master Orchestrator (CEO) created at company root with CEO deferral clause if missing. Pre-v2.1 files like `00-START-HERE.md` are preserved.

### Version

`skill-version.txt` bumped to `10.5.1`.

### What's no longer a hand-touch (RUNBOOK Section 5)

- ✅ `build-workforce.py` post-build call — now automatic
- ✅ `install.sh` shared-utils copy — fixed in install.sh
- ✅ Command Center `src/lib/persona-selector.ts` — created and points at `persona-selector-v2.py`

---

## [v10.5.0] — 2026-05-17 — Wave 3: v2.1 Integration Layer

### Added — scripts/

- **`post-build-role-workspaces.py`** — Post-hoc role-level workspace creator. Walks `[ZHC]/[company]/departments/` and creates role folders for every department missing them. Reads from `suggested-roles/[dept]-suggested-roles.md` to determine role list. Includes Master Orchestrator (CEO) creation at company root with CEO deferral clause variant. Idempotent.
- **`persona-selector-v2.py`** — v2.1-aware drop-in alternative to `select-persona-for-task.py`. Adds stickiness check, adaptive weights, behavioral profile reading, hybrid mode, weight override application.
- **`gemini-section-indexer.py`** — Section-level indexer. 14 vectors per persona (one per `##` section) instead of 80+ character chunks. Real Gemini embeddings when `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set; deterministic fallback otherwise.
- **`run-v2.1-migrations.sh`** — Orchestrates: platform detect → migrate deferral clauses → re-index Gemini at section level → create role workspaces. One command.
- **`verify-v2.1-installation.sh`** — End-to-end smoke test. 36 checks across file existence, Python syntax, bash syntax, and runtime execution.

### Added — root

- **`RUNBOOK-v2.1.md`** (in skill root) — Operator runbook covering upgrade flow, day-to-day scripts, persona stickiness walkthrough, hand-touch integration list, cron recommendations, troubleshooting, rollback.

### Version

`skill-version.txt` bumped to `10.5.0`.

---

## [v10.4.1] — 2026-05-17 — Wave 2 Execution

### Added

- `scripts/infer-task-category.py` — Classifies a task description into one of 14 task categories. Used by persona stickiness (v2.0 Ch 13) and adaptive weights (v2.0 Ch 17).
- `scripts/create-role-workspaces.py` — Creates role-level workspaces inside a department. Each role gets its own folder with unique IDENTITY/SOUL/MEMORY/HEARTBEAT/how-to.md files plus symlinks to the company-root AGENTS/TOOLS/USER.md. Master Orchestrator role uses the CEO variant of the Persona Governance Override clause.

### Moved

These previously-mandatory suggested-roles files moved to `suggested-roles/_deprecated/`:
- `creative-suggested-roles.md` (folded into Graphics + Video + Audio)
- `hr-people-suggested-roles.md` (no longer mandatory)
- `it-tech-suggested-roles.md` (replaced by OpenClaw Maintenance)
- `operations-suggested-roles.md` (distributed across departments)

Preserved for Audit/Resume mode (Option C) backward compatibility.

### Version

`skill-version.txt` bumped to `10.4.1`.

---

### Changed
- Interview density: ~50-65 questions → ~28-30 questions
- All assisting language preserved from v9.6.0: "I Don't Know" 6-step flow, hesitation detection, plain-English progress, pause/resume, specialist auto-staffing

### skill-version.txt

---

## [v1.5.0] - March 7, 2026

### Changed
