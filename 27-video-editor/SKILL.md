# Video Editor (Local Opus Clip Alternative)

Edit existing videos locally using simple, predictable scripts.

This skill is built around a small set of shell scripts (FFmpeg, yt-dlp, Whisper, PySceneDetect) plus a couple Python helpers for B-roll merging and text overlays.

## What you can do

- Download a video from a URL (YouTube and many other sites)
- Cut a clip by timestamp
- Resize/reframe for TikTok, Reels, Shorts, Instagram square, YouTube, LinkedIn
- Auto-generate captions with Whisper and burn them into the video
- Run a full "social clip" workflow (cut + resize + caption)
- Analyze a video for scene changes and suggested B-roll insertion points
- Merge B-roll into a talking-head video while keeping the original audio continuous

## Requirements

- FFmpeg installed (`ffmpeg` command)
- Python 3 (for Whisper + scenedetect + the B-roll merge helper)
- Tools installed via pip:
  - `yt-dlp`
  - `scenedetect`
  - `openai-whisper`
  - `moviepy` (used by the B-roll merge helper)

See `INSTALL.md` for step-by-step setup.

## Quick start (most common workflow)

1. Download a video.

```bash
./scripts/download.sh \
  --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
  --output input.mp4
```

2. Turn it into a TikTok/Reels/Shorts clip (cut + resize + captions).

```bash
./scripts/social-clip.sh \
  --input input.mp4 \
  --start 00:00:30 \
  --duration 30 \
  --platform tiktok \
  --output clip-captioned-vertical.mp4
```

3. (Optional) Skip captions if you want a clean clip.

```bash
./scripts/social-clip.sh \
  --input input.mp4 \
  --start 00:00:30 \
  --duration 30 \
  --platform tiktok \
  --output clip-vertical.mp4 \
  --skip-caption
```

## B-roll workflow (talking head to professional B-roll cut)

- Read `BROLL-WORKFLOW.md` for the full, detailed SOP.
- Use `./scripts/broll-workflow.sh` to stage a project folder, analyze the video, extract audio, and print suggested insertion points.

## Notes about analysis output

`analyze-video.sh` relies on PySceneDetect.

- The number of scenes and suggested insertion points can vary depending on:
  - the content
  - the detection method you choose
  - the PySceneDetect version
- Treat the JSON output as helpful suggestions, not a guaranteed structure for downstream automation.
