# GHL MCP — How to Use It Day to Day

This document explains how to USE the 5-tier GHL access chain after setup is complete. If setup is not done yet, read INSTALL.md first.

After setup, your agent can route GHL requests through Official MCP, Community MCP, raw API, browser, and Codex Computer Use — in that order of preference.

## The Cardinal Rule

**Try each tier in numerical order. Do NOT skip tiers.** This rule lives in SOUL.md as a 🔴 cardinal protocol. Violating it is a documented past failure. The rule is binding.

## Disclosure Header Format

Every reply that surfaces GHL / GoHighLevel / Convert and Flow / LeadConnector data MUST begin with this header on its own line:

```
[GHL tier used: N — tool_name]
```

Examples:
- `[GHL tier used: 1 — locations_get-location]`
- `[GHL tier used: 2 — ghl_list_products]`
- `[GHL tier used: 2 (Tier 1 lacked tool: products) — ghl_list_products]`
- `[GHL tier used: 3 (Tier 1+2 lacked tool: webhook_log) — raw API GET /hooks/]`

If you fall through tiers, the header must show the chain so the audit is complete.

## When to Use Which Tier

### Tier 1 — Official GHL MCP (`ghl-mcp`)

Use first when the task is in one of these domains:

| Domain | Example tools |
|---|---|
| Contacts | `contacts_get-contact`, `contacts_create-contact`, `contacts_search-contacts`, `contacts_upsert-contact`, `contacts_add-tags`, `contacts_remove-tags` |
| Conversations | `conversations_send-a-new-message`, `conversations_get-messages`, `conversations_search-conversation` |
| Opportunities | `opportunities_get-opportunity`, `opportunities_update-opportunity`, `opportunities_search-opportunity`, `opportunities_get-pipelines` |
| Calendars | `calendars_get-calendar-events`, `calendars_get-appointment-notes` |
| Locations | `locations_get-location`, `locations_get-custom-fields` |
| Blogs | `blogs_create-blog-post`, `blogs_update-blog-post`, `blogs_get-blog-post`, `blogs_get-blogs`, `blogs_check-url-slug-exists` |
| Emails | `emails_fetch-template`, `emails_create-template` |
| Social Media | `social-media-posting_create-post`, `social-media-posting_edit-post`, `social-media-posting_get-post`, `social-media-posting_get-posts`, `social-media-posting_get-account`, `social-media-posting_get-social-media-statistics` |
| Payments (read-only) | `payments_get-order-by-id`, `payments_list-transactions` |

**Total: 36 tools.**

### Tier 2 — Community GHL MCP (`ghl-community-mcp`)

Use when Tier 1 lacks the needed tool. Domains:

| Domain | Primary tools |
|---|---|
| Products | `ghl_list_products`, `ghl_get_product`, `ghl_create_product`, `ghl_update_product`, `ghl_delete_product`, `ghl_create_price`, `ghl_list_prices`, `ghl_create_product_collection`, `ghl_list_product_collections`, `ghl_list_inventory`, `ghl_bulk_edit_products` |
| Invoices | `list_invoices`, `get_invoice`, `create_invoice`, `update_invoice`, `delete_invoice`, `send_invoice`, `view_invoice`, `generate_invoice_number` |
| Recurring billing / subscriptions | `list_invoice_schedules`, `get_invoice_schedule`, `create_invoice_schedule`, `update_invoice_schedule`, `list_subscriptions`, `get_subscription_by_id`, `update_saas_subscription`, `rebilling_update` |
| Estimates | `list_estimates`, `create_estimate`, `send_estimate`, `create_invoice_from_estimate`, `generate_estimate_number` |
| Payments (full) | `list_orders`, `get_order_by_id`, `list_transactions`, `get_transaction_by_id`, `list_gateways`, `record_order_payment` |
| Coupons | `list_coupons`, `create_coupon`, `update_coupon`, `delete_coupon`, `get_coupon` |
| Voice AI | `create_voice_ai_agent`, `update_voice_ai_agent`, `list_voice_ai_agents`, `get_voice_ai_call_log` |
| Phone System | `ghl_buy_phone_number`, `ghl_list_phone_numbers`, `update_phone_number`, `ghl_get_call_recording`, `update_call_forwarding` |
| Agent Studio | `ghl_create_agent`, `ghl_update_agent`, `ghl_deploy_agent`, `ghl_list_agents` |
| Workflows | `ghl_list_workflows`, `ghl_get_workflow`, `ghl_create_workflow`, `ghl_clone_workflow`, `ghl_trigger_workflow`, `ghl_publish_workflow` |

**Total: 588 tools.** For anything not in this table, run live discovery:
```bash
curl $GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL/tools | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Tier 3 — Direct REST API + skill 29 reference

Use only when neither MCP covers the call. Resolve which reference file to read:

```bash
# Identify domain from the task, then read the matching reference
ls "$MASTER_FILES_DIR/29-ghl-convert-and-flow/references/"
# contacts.md, conversations.md, opportunities.md, calendars.md, locations.md, payments.md, etc.
```

Then build the curl call:
```bash
curl -sS -X GET "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/<endpoint>?locationId=$GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Version: 2021-07-28"
```

Some modules use `Version: 2021-04-15`. Always check the reference file for the correct version header.

### Tier 4 — Playwright browser

Use when the operation can only be done in the UI (no API endpoint exists). Login at the client's white-label URL or `https://app.gohighlevel.com`. Use `launchPersistentContext`, never `launch()`.

### Tier 5 — Codex Computer Use

Last resort. Route through `codex-computer-use` sub-agent with model `codex/gpt-5.5`. Default timeout 45 minutes.

## Verify-Before-Fallthrough Protocol

When a tier returns 404 / 502 / connection refused / "not found":

1. **Re-read the canonical state block in AGENTS.md.** Compare URL/port/path against what you actually called. If they don't match, fix and retry.
2. **Hit `/health`** for that tier:
   - Tier 1: `curl https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY" ...`
   - Tier 2: `curl $GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL/health`
3. If health passes, the server is fine — your call shape is wrong. Fix and retry.
4. If health fails, attempt recovery:
   - Tier 2 macOS: `launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.clawd.ghl-mcp`
   - Tier 2 Linux: `sudo systemctl restart ghl-mcp`
5. Only after recovery fails, fall through to the next tier. The disclosure header must reflect the actual reason.

## 🔴 Rate-Limit Protocol — 429 is NOT a fallthrough trigger

GHL enforces per-location rate limits across ALL THREE tiers — they share the same backend bucket. Switching tiers does NOT bypass.

**Limits:** 100 req/10s burst | 200,000 req/day per location.

**Headers on every response:**
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` (burst budget)
- `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining` (daily budget left)
- `X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily` (200000)
- `X-RateLimit-Daily-Reset` (seconds until reset)

**Pre-flight before bulk ops:**

```bash
# Cheap probe — read headers
curl -sS -i -X POST "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY" \
  -H "locationId: $GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID" \
  -H "Version: 2021-07-28" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' \
  | grep -i "x-ratelimit-daily-remaining"
```

If `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining < 1000`: STOP. Compute reset time from `X-RateLimit-Daily-Reset` (seconds), surface to owner as "Rate limit nearly exhausted — back at HH:MM ET". Do NOT proceed.

**On 429 from any tier:**

1. Parse `X-RateLimit-Daily-Reset` (or `Retry-After` if present).
2. Compute clock time: `reset_time = now + reset_seconds`.
3. Surface to owner: "Rate limited — back at HH:MM ET (in X hours)."
4. **DO NOT retry blindly. DO NOT fall through to a different tier** (all three share the same quota).
5. Log the incident to MEMORY.md under "## Rate Limit Incidents".

**Batching rules:**
- Use `limit=100` on list endpoints, not many `limit=5` calls.
- Cache list results in MEMORY.md for ≥5 minutes; don't refetch per turn.
- Polling intervals ≥60 sec; non-critical ≥5 min.

**What burns quota fast (avoid):**
- Test loops during development that re-call live endpoints
- n8n workflows hitting GHL every few seconds
- Community MCP polling intervals set too tight
- Agent re-fetching the same products/contacts list every turn instead of caching

**Documented past failure:** 2026-05-13, BlackCEO location `Mct54Bwi1KlNouGXQcDX` burned all 200k daily calls. All three tiers returned the same underlying 429 simultaneously. Root cause was test loops + polling + per-turn re-fetches. Recovery: wait ~7 hours for daily reset; do NOT attempt workarounds.

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT do these)

- ❌ "Tier 1 doesn't have X → I'll use Tier 3 because Tier 3 has X." → Wrong. Use Tier 2.
- ❌ Hardcoding a port number from session memory. → Always use `$GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL`.
- ❌ "Tier 2 crashed earlier in this session → skip it." → Wrong. Restart and retry.
- ❌ "Tier 3 is faster / cleaner / I prefer raw API." → Personal preference is not a routing override.
- ❌ Skipping the disclosure header on a GHL response. → Required on every GHL-data response.

## Common Cross-Tier Workflows

### Product → Invoice → Subscription (Tier 2 only)

```
ghl_create_product          → create the product record
  ↓
ghl_create_price            → attach pricing (set type=recurring, interval=month for subscriptions)
  ↓
ghl_update_product          → set status=active/live
  ↓
create_invoice              → create invoice linked to contact
  ↓
send_invoice                → deliver to client
  ↓
record_order_payment        → log payment received
```

For monthly subscriptions, after the price is created:
```
create_invoice_schedule           → define recurrence
  ↓
update_invoice_schedule           → activate it
  ↓
auto_payment_invoice_schedule     → enable auto-charge on file
```

### Contact lookup + payment history (Tier 1 + Tier 2)

```
Tier 1: contacts_search-contacts → find the contact
  ↓
Tier 2: list_transactions filtered by contactId → payment history
```

Disclosure: `[GHL tier used: 1+2 — contacts_search-contacts; list_transactions]`

### Social media post via MCP (Tier 1, replaces skill 35's raw API call)

```
Tier 1: social-media-posting_create-post
  ↓
Body includes content, media URLs, platform targets, schedule
```

This replaces the raw `POST /social-media-posting/oauth/.../accounts` call that skill 35 used pre-v36.

## Health Check Cheatsheet

```bash
# Tier 1 — verify auth
curl -sS -m 5 -X POST "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY" \
  -H "locationId: $GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID" \
  -H "Version: 2021-07-28" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' \
  | grep "^data:" | head -1 | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; print('Tier 1 OK, tools:', len(json.load(sys.stdin).get('result',{}).get('tools',[])))"

# Tier 2 — verify server running
curl -sS -m 5 $GHL_COMMUNITY_MCP_URL/health

# Tier 2 service status
# macOS:
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.clawd.ghl-mcp | grep -E "state|pid"
# Linux:
systemctl status ghl-mcp
```

## When Setup Is Done and Things Just Work

The disclosure header is your audit trail. Every response with a tier header that matches the task domain is a passing case. Anything missing the header, or showing tier 3 when tier 1 or 2 should have served the request, is a failure to investigate.
