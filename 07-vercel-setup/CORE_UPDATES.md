## 🔴 API-ONLY EXECUTION LOCK (SOVEREIGN)
- For this onboarding package, do NOT use service CLIs for GitHub, Vercel, or Context7.
- Do NOT use `gh`, `vercel`, or any Context7 CLI command for setup/auth.
- Use API-driven setup and browser-based account/token creation flows only.
- The only onboarding skill allowed to rely on CLI-specific service commands is Superdesign.
