# QC Checklist: Teach Yourself Protocol (TYP)

## 1. Purpose
Enables the agent to learn new knowledge in a structured way without bloating core workspace files.

## 2. Installation Checks
- [ ] Skill folder exists and contains `SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `CORE_UPDATES.md`, the full reference `.md`, and the `.skill` package.
- [ ] A master files folder is present under /data/downloads using one of the documented naming variants, with `apis/`, `skills/`, `processes/`, and `references/` subfolders.
- [ ] The full TYP documentation has been copied into the master files folder, not pasted into core workspace files.
- [ ] Any helper files copied into `~/.openclaw/skills/01-teach-yourself-protocol` remain readable; no executable script is required in this skill folder, so executable-bit check is N/A unless a helper script was added later.
- [ ] Core files referenced by install (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and when applicable `IDENTITY.md`) are writable.

## 3. Dependency Checks
- [ ] OpenClaw is installed and responsive: `openclaw status`.
- [ ] Workspace write access exists for `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `IDENTITY.md`.
- [ ] The master files location under /data/downloads is accessible and not duplicated under multiple conflicting names.
- [ ] No external API keys or CLIs are required beyond normal OpenClaw file access.

## 4. Key Detection
- [ ] No API key is required for TYP. QC should PASS only if the installer does **not** ask for any secret.
- [ ] Smart detection instead checks knowledge locations: search core files for `Teach Yourself Protocol` or `TYP`, then search the master files folder for the full protocol copy.
- [ ] Confirm no secret placeholder or fake credential was introduced while installing this skill.

## 5. Functional Checks
- [ ] Ask: “What is the Teach Yourself Protocol?” Expected answer mentions the three-layer knowledge architecture: core summaries, deep files, and folder structure.
- [ ] Ask: “Where do full documents go?” Expected answer points to the master files folder, not `AGENTS.md` or `TOOLS.md`.
- [ ] Give a short “Teach yourself this…” prompt and verify the agent announces TYP activation before doing any learning work.
- [ ] Verify the agent creates or updates a deep reference file and only adds a lean summary plus file path in core files.
- [ ] Verify the agent checks for conflicts or duplicates before creating new knowledge files.

## 6. QC Score
- Score this skill from **0 to 10** after running the checks above.
- Suggested rubric:
  - **10/10**: All installation, dependency, key-detection, and functional checks pass with no ambiguity.
  - **8-9/10**: Core behavior works, but one or two non-critical items need cleanup or documentation fixes.
  - **6-7/10**: Basic install exists, but the skill is missing a meaningful validation, dependency, or behavior requirement.
  - **0-5/10**: Missing prerequisite pieces, broken verification path, wrong secrets handling, or failed functional tests.
- Record final result here:
  - **QC Score:** ____ / 10
  - **Status:** Pass / Needs Fix / Blocked
  - **Notes:** ____________________________________________

## 7. QC Loop Rule
- Run at most **5 total QC/fix rounds** for this skill.
- After each failed round:
  1. Record exactly which checklist items failed.
  2. Apply the smallest targeted fix.
  3. Re-run only the failed checks plus any directly affected dependencies.
- If the skill still fails after the **5th round**, stop and escalate instead of continuing to loop.
