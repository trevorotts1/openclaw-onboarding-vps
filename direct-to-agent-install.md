# Direct-to-Agent OpenClaw Install

**For:** Users who don't want to (or can't) run the terminal `curl ... | bash` command.
**Purpose:** Lets the user paste a single block of instructions directly to their agent (Telegram, OpenClaw dashboard, or any other agent surface) and have the agent perform the entire onboarding without ever touching a terminal.
**Pairs with:** `install.sh` (terminal path). Same end state. Triple-fire trigger (N22) fires on this path too.

---

## How to use

1. Open your agent surface (Telegram chat with your OpenClaw agent, or the OpenClaw dashboard chat).
2. Copy the ENTIRE block under "BEGIN AGENT INSTRUCTIONS" below.
3. Paste it as a single message to your agent.
4. The agent will follow the steps to install OpenClaw on your machine end-to-end.
5. Reply to any questions it asks (it may need your Telegram chat ID for pairing, etc.).

The agent is doing the same work `install.sh` would have done in your terminal — just from inside your agent.

## BEGIN AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

You are about to install or update OpenClaw Onboarding via the direct-to-agent path (no terminal). Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT improvise.

### 0. Pre-flight — detect platform
Determine whether the target host is:
- **Mac:** `~/.openclaw/`, `~/clawd/`, `~/Downloads/openclaw-master-files/` apply.
- **VPS Hostinger Docker:** `/data/.openclaw/`, `/data/.openclaw/workspace/`, `/data/.openclaw/master-files/` apply.

For the rest of these instructions, substitute the correct paths for the detected platform.

### 1. Confirm capacity envelope
Verify the runtime allows:
- `maxSpawnDepth` ≥ 4
- `maxChildren` ≥ 20
- `maxConcurrent` ≥ 100
- `thinking` = "high"
- Wave concurrency cap: Mac ≤ 10 worker sub-agents, VPS ≤ 5

If any value is lower, halt and ask the user whether to proceed at reduced parallelism.

### 2. Pre-flight web research (N15)
Run the equivalent of `bash scripts/web-research-preflight.sh` — fetch:
- `https://docs.openclaw.ai/` (canonical settings reference)
- `https://ollama.com/library/<model>` for every `ollama/*` model in `openclaw.json`
- `https://openrouter.ai/<vendor>/<model>` for every `openrouter/*` model in `openclaw.json`

Write the consolidated result to `<config-root>/preflight-research.json`. If docs.openclaw.ai disagrees with the bootstrap/sub-agent settings below, **docs win** — log the discrepancy as a P1 ticket but use the docs values.

### 3. Bootstrap + sub-agent settings (N11, N12, N13)
Confirm or set:
- `bootstrap.maxChars = 200000`
- `bootstrap.maxTotalChars = 400000`
- `subagents.maxSpawnDepth = 4`
- `subagents.maxChildren = 20`
- `subagents.maxConcurrent = 100`
- `thinking = "high"` (every agent — orchestrator, sub-agent, QC)

### 4. Canonical workspace files
At workspace root, create or update:
- `USER.md` (owner profile + Behavioral Identity Profile)
- `AGENTS.md` (company-wide rules — symlinked into every per-role workspace)
- `TOOLS.md` (company-wide tool registry — symlinked)
- `SOUL.md` (company mission/beliefs)

### 5. Download skill files from GitHub
Fetch the latest skill bundle from the platform-appropriate repo:
- Mac: `https://github.com/trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding`
- VPS: `https://github.com/trevorotts1/openclaw-onboarding-vps`

Place every skill folder under `<skills-dir>/`. Place root files (`Start Here.md`, `INSTALL-CONTRACT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `cron-prompt.txt`, `check-updates.sh`, `force-update.sh`, etc.) at `<config-root>/`. Place `shared-utils/` under `<skills-dir>/shared-utils/`.

### 6. Read the rules (N3, N4)
Before installing ANY skill, read every file in:
- `<skills-dir>/Start Here.md`
- `<config-root>/INSTALL-CONTRACT.md` (Rule 0: wave concurrency cap; Rule 1: read all .md before acting; etc.)
- `<config-root>/AGENTS.md` (N2 / N5 / N8 hard rules)

### 7. Install skills in waves
For each wave, BEFORE spawning sub-agents, gate with:

```
bash <skills-dir>/check-wave-concurrency.sh --proposed <N> --reason "wave-N-skill-install"
```

Exit 0 → spawn allowed. Exit 1 → reduce N or split the wave.

For each skill in the wave:
1. Spawn a dedicated worker sub-agent (non-Anthropic per N1 — use `select_model.py` purpose_tier="installer-subagent" to pick the model)
2. The orchestrator passes the FULL TEXT of the skill's `SKILL.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `QC.md`, every `.py`/`.sh` in `scripts/` to the worker (N8)
3. Worker reads all files, then executes `INSTALL.md` steps in declared order (N3, N4)
4. Worker exits with structured status
5. Independent QC sub-agent (different from worker per N5) runs:
   ```
   bash <skills-dir>/qc-agent.sh <skill-folder-name>
   ```
   Exit 0 + rubric ≥ 8.5 = PASS. Below 8.5 → reinstall (max 5 retry loops per N6).

### 8. Run system integrity check
After all waves complete:

```
bash <config-root>/skills/qc-system-integrity.sh
```

Must exit 0.

### 9. Run AI Workforce Interview (Skill 23)
Drive Skill 23 in interactive mode (or non-interactive with a saved config) to build the ZHC structure under `<workspace>/zero-human-company/<company-slug>/`.

### 10. Build per-role workspaces
For each department in the interview output:

```
python3 <skills-dir>/23-ai-workforce-blueprint/scripts/create_role_workspaces.py \
  --dept-path <workspace>/zero-human-company/<slug>/departments/<dept> \
  --roles-json <roles.json>
```

This creates the 7-file role layout (4 unique + 3 symlinks + how-to.md) AND the SOP/ subfolder AND writes `governing-personas.md` at department level.

### 11. Install Sunday cron
Install the weekly update-check cron at `0 3 * * 0` (3am Sunday):

```
openclaw cron create --name weekly-onboarding-update \
  --cron "0 3 * * 0" --tz America/New_York \
  --channel telegram --to <chat_id> \
  --message-file <config-root>/cron-prompt.txt
```

### 12. Triple-fire confirmation
Confirm the install kickoff fired on all three channels:
- **Telegram:** message sent to paired chat
- **AGENTS.md flag:** marker written at `<config-root>/AGENTS.md` confirming onboarding kickoff
- **This reply:** the agent's reply to the user with a summary

### 13. Reply with summary
Reply to the user with:
- Total skills installed (target: 33)
- QC pass/fail count per wave
- ZHC location
- Active department list
- Master Orchestrator agent ID
- Any P0 issues discovered during install

### Hard rules (apply throughout)
- No shortcuts. Read every .md and every script before acting on it.
- No self-QC. The agent that installs cannot also QC.
- All sub-agents non-Anthropic (Ollama Cloud → OpenRouter → Gemini).
- Persona governance on EVERY non-mechanical task.
- Master Orchestrator does NO work — sub-agents do work.

## Comparison to the terminal `install.sh` path

| Step | Terminal install.sh | Direct-to-agent (this doc) |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Detect platform | bash conditionals | agent reads platform |
| Web research pre-flight | scripts/web-research-preflight.sh | agent fetches the same URLs |
| Settings config | install.sh writes openclaw.json | agent writes openclaw.json |
| Skill download | install.sh git/curl clones | agent git/curl clones |
| Wave install + QC | install.sh + qc-agent.sh | agent invokes same scripts |
| Triple-fire kickoff | fire_install_kickoff_triplet() | agent sends Telegram + writes AGENTS.md flag + replies in chat |

**Same end state. Different driver.** The terminal path is faster for power users; the direct-to-agent path is for users who never want to open a terminal.

---

## When to use which

- **Terminal:** First install on a fresh Mac or VPS, or when you want a verifiable log file (`$LOG_FILE` written by install.sh).
- **Direct-to-agent:** Subsequent updates, or when the user isn't comfortable with terminal, or when the user is updating from inside Telegram on mobile.
- **Sunday cron:** Same direct-to-agent flow runs automatically via `cron-prompt.txt` every Sunday at 03:00.

---

**This document is the canonical direct-to-agent install spec.** Any agent receiving these instructions should follow them exactly. The instructions are versioned with the repo — re-fetch from GitHub `main` for the latest.

Versioned by: openclaw-onboarding (Mac) and openclaw-onboarding-vps (VPS).
