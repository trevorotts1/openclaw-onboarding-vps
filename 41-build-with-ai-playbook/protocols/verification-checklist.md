# Verification Checklist -- Skill 41

## Purpose

The 12-point post-build verification checklist. Run this after every workflow build BEFORE publishing. A build without verification is incomplete.

## The 12 Points

   - The generated workflow name matches exactly what was specified in the prompt.
   - If the AI renamed it, verify the new name is acceptable.

   - Trigger type matches the prompt (e.g., Contact Created, Form Submitted).
   - Any filters specified in the prompt are present and configured correctly.

3. **All referenced tags exist and are spelled correctly**
   - Every tag in Add/Remove Contact Tag actions exists in the location.

6. **Action sequence matches the prompt (order, configuration)**
   - Actions are in the same order as specified.
   - Each action's configuration matches (template, recipient, message, etc.).
   - No actions were dropped or added unexpectedly.

7. **If/Else conditions evaluate the right fields with correct operators**
   - Condition field matches the prompt.
   - Operator matches (is, is not, contains, greater than, less than, empty).
   - AND/OR logic matches the prompt.
   - Both YES and NO branches are configured.

8. **Wait steps have correct duration**

   - Timeout branches (if specified) are configured.

9. **Webhook URL is correct and method matches the prompt**
   - URL matches exactly.
   - Method matches (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

10. **Webhook headers include Content-Type: application/json (for raw JSON body)**
    - For CUSTOM mode with raw JSON body, Content-Type header is present.
    - Authorization header is present if specified.
    - Custom headers match the prompt.

11. **Settings: re-entry, stop on response, time windows are correct**
    - Allow Re-entry matches the prompt (yes/no).
    - Stop on Response matches the prompt.
    - Time window (business hours) matches the prompt.
    - Sender details (From Name, From Email, From Number) match.

12. **Test the workflow with a test contact before going live**
    - Use GHL's "Test Workflow" feature.
    - Select a test contact and click "Run Test."
    - Verify each action fired as expected.
    - Check execution logs for errors.

## Scoring

- Each point is worth 1 point (12 total).
- Score of 12/12 = ready to publish.
- Score of 10-11/12 = minor fixes needed; fix and re-verify.
- Score below 10/12 = significant issues; rebuild or manual fix required.

## Logging

Record the verification score in build-with-ai-events.jsonl:
- build_completed event: verification_score field
- verification_failed event: failed_items array + fix_suggested string
