# Google Workspace Setup - Examples

Real examples showing the Google Workspace setup in action, from the setup process itself to day-to-day usage.

---

## Example 1: Automated Setup (Agent-Driven)

The agent handles the full setup autonomously. When triggered, it:

1. Detects the account type (Workspace or Gmail)
2. Creates a GCP project
3. Enables the required APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets)
4. Creates a service account with domain-wide delegation
5. Downloads and secures the JSON key
6. Configures OpenClaw environment variables
7. Tests the connection

The agent proceeds continuously. It pauses only if it needs a browser login, a missing API key, or a 2FA code only the user can provide.

**Expected outcome:** When complete, the agent reports which services are live and what was configured.

## Example 2: Checking If Setup Worked (Gmail Test)

**What you type:**

```
Check my Gmail for unread messages
```

**What you see if it WORKED:**

```
You have 3 unread messages:

1. From: sarah@company.com
   Subject: "Q3 Budget Review"
   Received: Today at 2:15 PM

2. From: newsletter@industry.com
   Subject: "Weekly Industry Update"
   Received: Today at 10:00 AM

3. From: john@vendor.com
   Subject: "Invoice #1234"
   Received: Yesterday at 4:30 PM
```

**What you see if it DID NOT work:**

```
Error: 401 Unauthorized - Could not access Gmail.
```

If you see this error, check:
- Is the OAuth Consent Screen configured? (INSTALL.md Step 3)
- Is Domain-Wide Delegation authorized? (INSTALL.md Step 7)
- Did you enable the Gmail API? (INSTALL.md Step 2)

## Example 3: Checking If Setup Worked (Calendar Test)

**What you type:**

```
What is on my calendar today?
```

**What you see if it WORKED:**

```
You have 2 events today:

1. Team Standup
   Time: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM
   Location: Zoom (link attached)

2. Client Call with Pam Perry
   Time: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
   Location: Google Meet
```

**What you see if it DID NOT work:**

```
Error: 403 Forbidden - Insufficient permission for Calendar.
```

If you see this error, the calendar scope may not be in your Domain-Wide Delegation. Go back to INSTALL.md Step 7 Part B and make sure the scope list includes `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.

## Example 4: Searching Google Drive

## Example 5: Sending an Email

**What you type:**

```
Send an email to sarah@company.com with the subject "Meeting Reschedule" and say:
Hi Sarah, I need to move our meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday at the same time. Does that work for you? Thanks,
```

**What your AI does:**

at the same time. Does that work for you? Thanks,

## Example 6: Creating a Calendar Event

**What you type:**

```
Create a calendar event called "Strategy Session" for next Monday from 10 AM to 11:30 AM
```

**What your AI does:**

```
Calendar event created!

Title: Strategy Session
Date: Monday, March 10, 2026
Time: 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
Calendar: Primary

Link: https://calendar.google.com/event?eid=abc123...
```

## Example 7: Checking Environment Variables

If something is not working and you want to check your setup, open Terminal and run these commands:

**What you type in Terminal:**

```bash
echo $GCP_PROJECT_ID
echo $GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
echo $GCP_IMPERSONATE_USER
```

**What you should see:**

```
openclaw-ai-123456
OpenClaw-assistant@openclaw-ai-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com
user@yourdomain.com
```

If any of these come back blank, the environment variable is not set. Go back to INSTALL.md Step 8 and add it to your ~/.zshrc file.

---

## Example 8: Verifying API is Enabled

If a specific service is not working (for example, Sheets), check that the API is enabled:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
2. Look in the list of enabled APIs
3. If "Google Sheets API" is not in the list, go to the API Library and enable it (see INSTALL.md Step 2)

**What the enabled APIs page looks like:**

You will see a list showing:
- Gmail API - Enabled
- Google Calendar API - Enabled
- Google Drive API - Enabled
- Google Docs API - Enabled
- Google Sheets API - Enabled
- People API - Enabled

If any of these are missing, click on the API Library link and enable the missing ones.

---

## Example 9: Revoking Access in an Emergency

If you think your JSON key file has been compromised (someone else got a copy of it):

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Click on your service account email
3. Click the "Keys" tab
4. Find the key and click the trash icon to delete it
5. This immediately stops anyone from using that key

Then create a new key (INSTALL.md Step 5) and update your secrets folder with the new file.
