# Command Center Setup - Installation Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through activating your AI workforce as a live Command Center. The process has 8 phases. Some phases you do manually (like setting up Telegram). Other phases the agent does automatically.

**Important:** This skill requires Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint) to be complete first. The agent will check for this before proceeding.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites Check

The agent will verify these before starting:

### 1.1 Check Node.js Version
```bash
node --version
```
Expected: v18 or higher. If lower, update Node.js first.

### 1.2 Check Git Installation
```bash
git --version
```
Expected: Git is installed. If not, install Git first.

### 1.3 Check PM2 Installation
```bash
pm2 --version
```
Expected: PM2 is installed. If not, install it:

💬 Send Telegram message: "⏳ [Phase 1] Installing PM2 globally... this may take 1-2 minutes."

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

> **Timeout hint:** If `npm install -g pm2` takes longer than 3 minutes, kill it with Ctrl+C and retry with `npm install -g pm2 --prefer-offline`.

### 1.4 Verify Skill 23 Is Complete

The agent will scan for department folders in your master files area. These folders indicate Skill 23 was completed.

**What the agent looks for:**
- Department folders at `/data/clawd/departments/[name]/` (where Skill 23 writes them) — NO -dept suffix
- Also checks `~/.openclaw/workspaces/command-center/` and `~/Downloads/` for department folders
- Each folder should contain role definitions

**If Skill 23 is NOT found:**
The agent will STOP and tell you:
> "Skill 23 (AI Workforce Blueprint) must be completed first. Please finish that skill, then return to activate your Command Center."

**If Skill 23 IS found:**
The agent will identify which departments you chose and proceed.

---

## Phase 2: Telegram Setup (You Do This Manually)

This phase requires you to use the Telegram app on your phone or computer. The agent will guide you step by step.

### Step 1: Open Telegram and Start a New Group
1. Open the Telegram app on your device
2. Tap the compose icon (looks like a pencil in a box)
3. Tap "New Group" from the menu

**What you should see:** A screen asking you to add members to the new group.

### Step 2: Add Your Bot to the Group
1. Search for your bot's name (the one you use with OpenClaw, like @clawdbot)
2. Tap on your bot to add it as a member
3. Tap the arrow or "Next" to continue

**What you should see:** The bot is now listed as a selected member.

### Step 3: Name Your Group
1. Type the group name: "[Your Company Name] Command Center"
   - For example: "BlackCEO Command Center" or "Acme Inc Command Center"
2. Tap "Create" to create the group

**What you should see:** Your new group is created and you are now in the chat.

### Step 4: Enable Topics (Converts to Supergroup)
1. Tap the group name at the top to open Group Info
2. Tap the edit icon (looks like a pencil)
3. Scroll down and find "Topics"
4. Toggle the switch to turn Topics ON
5. Tap "Save" or the back arrow

**What you should see:**
- Telegram will convert the group to a "supergroup"
- You may see a brief loading indicator
- The group now supports organized topics

### Step 5: Promote Your Bot to Admin
1. Go back to Group Info (tap the group name again)
2. Find "Members" and tap it
3. Find your bot in the member list and tap it
4. Tap "Promote to Admin"

**What you should see:** A list of admin permissions.

### Step 6: Enable Required Permissions
Enable these permissions by toggling each one ON:
- [x] Manage Topics
- [x] Delete Messages
- [x] Pin Messages
- [x] Send Messages

Tap "Save" when done.

**What you should see:** Your bot is now listed as an administrator.

### Step 7: Activate the Group
1. Send any message in the group (like "Hello" or "Testing")
2. This allows the agent to detect the group ID

**What you should see:** Your message appears in the chat.

**What happens next:** The agent detects the group and can now create topics automatically.

---

## Phase 3: Workspace Creation (Agent Does This Automatically)

The agent will now create the workspace structure for your Command Center.

### 3.1 Create Base Directory
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspaces/command-center/
```

### 3.2 Create Department Subdirectories
For each department you chose in Skill 23, the agent will create:
- A subdirectory named after the department
- IDENTITY.md with a unique 5-line identity
- MEMORY.md with department-specific memory
- A memory/ folder for daily logs

Example structure:
```
~/.openclaw/workspaces/command-center/
├── marketing/
│   ├── IDENTITY.md
│   ├── MEMORY.md
│   └── memory/
├── sales/
│   ├── IDENTITY.md
│   ├── MEMORY.md
│   └── memory/
└── operations/
    ├── IDENTITY.md
    ├── MEMORY.md
    └── memory/
```

### 3.3 Create Symlinks to Shared Files
Each department workspace will have symlinks to shared files from your main workspace:
- TOOLS.md
- AGENTS.md
- HEARTBEAT.md
- SOUL.md

**Important:** The agent uses absolute paths (like `/Users/username/clawd/TOOLS.md`), not tilde paths (`/data/clawd/TOOLS.md`). This ensures symlinks work correctly.

---


**🔴 GATE CHECK: DO NOT proceed to Phase 4 until every department workspace folder exists at ~/.openclaw/workspaces/command-center/. List the folders and verify. If any are missing, create them now. DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE.**

## Phase 4: Agent Configuration (Agent Does This Automatically)

The agent will configure OpenClaw to recognize your department agents.

### 4.1 Backup Your Config First
The agent follows the backup protocol:
```bash
# Creates a timestamped backup
cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json ~/Downloads/openclaw-backups/openclaw-backup-[DATE].json
```

### 4.2 Add Department Agents
For each department, the agent adds an entry to `agents.list[]`:

```json
{
  "id": "dept-marketing",
  "name": "Chief Marketing Officer",
  "workspace": "/Users/username/.openclaw/workspaces/command-center/marketing",
  "memorySearch": {
    "extraPaths": ["/Users/username/Downloads/openclaw-master-files"],
    "multimodal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "modalities": ["all"]
    },
    "fallback": "none"
  }
}
```

**Important notes:**
- Agent ID format: `dept-[dept-name]` (matches Skill 23's agent ID format)
- Workspace paths are absolute (not tilde paths)
- extraPaths points to your master files folder using absolute path
- Sandboxing is NOT enabled (department heads need full access)

### 4.2b Wiki Context Injection
Each department agent is configured to use the Memory Wiki for structured knowledge retrieval:

```json
{
  "wiki": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoSearch": true,
    "contextInjection": {
      "onStartup": true,
      "onTaskSwitch": true,
      "maxResults": 5
    }
  }
}
```

This enables department heads to:
- Search coaching theories via `wiki_search`
- Retrieve SOPs and playbooks via `wiki_get`
- Access persona blueprints from the Book-to-Persona system
- Maintain consistent methodology across all department work

### 4.3 Add Telegram Group to Channels
The agent adds your Telegram group to the channels configuration:

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "id": "-1001234567890",
        "name": "BlackCEO Command Center",
        "groupPolicy": "open",
        "requireMention": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Validate Configuration
The agent runs validation:
```bash
openclaw config validate
```

**If validation fails:**
- The agent restores the backup config
- Stops and reports the error
- Does NOT proceed until you fix the issue

**If validation passes:**
- Proceeds to Phase 5

---


**🔴 GATE CHECK: DO NOT proceed to Phase 5 until every department has an entry in agents.list[] in openclaw.json. Count the entries and verify against your department list. If any are missing, add them now. DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE.**

## Phase 5: Telegram Topic Creation (Agent Does This Automatically)

The agent creates one topic per department, plus a Cross-Department topic.

### 5.1 Create Department Topics
For each department (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Operations), the agent:

```bash
# Example: Create Marketing topic
# Uses the message tool with action: "topic-create"
```

The agent records each topic ID returned by Telegram.

### 5.2 Create Cross-Department Topic
The agent creates a general topic for interdepartmental collaboration:
- Name: "Cross-Department"
- Purpose: Messages that span multiple departments

### 5.3 Record Topic IDs
The agent saves all topic IDs for the binding step.

### 5.4 Add Topic Bindings to Config
For each topic, the agent adds a binding to `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "agentId": "dept-marketing",
      "peer": {
        "kind": "group",
        "id": "-1001234567890",
        "topic": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Each department agent is bound to its specific topic. Messages in that topic go directly to that agent.

---


**🔴 GATE CHECK: DO NOT proceed to Phase 6 until every department has a Telegram topic created. Count the topics and verify against your department list. If any are missing, create them now. DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE.**

## Phase 6: Dashboard Deployment (Agent Does This Automatically)

The agent deploys the visual Kanban dashboard.

### 6.1 Clone the Dashboard Repository
```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir -p command-center
cd command-center
git clone https://github.com/trevorotts1/blackceo-command-center.git .
```

### 6.2 Install Dependencies

💬 Send Telegram message: "⏳ [Phase 6] Installing dashboard dependencies... this may take 2-5 minutes."

```bash
npm install
```

> **Timeout hint:** If `npm install` takes longer than 5 minutes, kill it with Ctrl+C and retry with `npm install --prefer-offline`. If it still hangs, check your network connection and run `npm cache clean --force` before retrying.

### 6.3 Configure the Dashboard
The agent updates the configuration file with:
- Your company name
- Your department list
- Your agent IDs

### 6.4 Start with PM2

💬 Send Telegram message: "⏳ [Phase 6] Starting the dashboard server via PM2..."

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
```

### 6.5 Seed Department Workspaces into Database (MANDATORY)

💬 Send Telegram message: "⏳ [Phase 6] Seeding department workspaces into the database..."

After the dashboard starts, run the workspace seeding script to populate the database with all your department workspaces. Without this step, the workspace selector will only show the default workspace.

```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/onboarding/32-command-center-setup/scripts/seed-workspaces.py
```

Expected output: "Seeding complete. Inserted: [count] | Skipped (already existed): 0" (where [count] matches your number of departments)

If it says "Could not find mission-control.db" -- verify the dashboard started correctly in step 6.4 before running this.

### 6.6 Verify Dashboard is Accessible
The agent checks that the dashboard loads at:
```
http://localhost:4000
```

**What you should see:** The workspace selector screen showing all your department workspaces as cards you can click into. Each card shows task counts and agent count for that department.

---


**🔴 GATE CHECK: DO NOT proceed to Phase 6b until the dashboard is running on localhost:4000 and the workspace seeding script has been run. Verify both. DO NOT SKIP THIS PHASE.**

## Phase 6b: VPS Deployment - Nginx Reverse Proxy + SSL

On VPS, we use nginx with certbot for SSL instead of cloudflared tunnels.

### 6b.1 Install nginx and certbot

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### 6b.2 Configure nginx reverse proxy

Create /etc/nginx/sites-available/command-center:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;  # Accept any hostname
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:
```bash
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/command-center /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 6b.3 Obtain SSL certificate

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d $(curl -s ifconfig.me) --non-interactive --agree-tos --email admin@localhost
```

### 6b.4 Verify HTTPS access

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
```

Expected: 200

---

**🔴 GATE CHECK: DO NOT proceed to Phase 7 until nginx returns 200. Verify with curl. The VPS uses nginx + certbot, NOT cloudflared tunnels.**

## Phase 7: Verification (Agent Does This Automatically)

💬 Send Telegram message: "⏳ [Phase 7] Running final verification tests across all departments..."

The agent runs tests to verify everything works.

### 7.1 Test Department Response
1. Agent sends a test message in one department topic
2. Verifies the correct department head responds

**Expected result:** The department head for that topic responds within 30 seconds.

### 7.2 Test Memory System
```bash
openclaw memory status dept-marketing
```

**Expected result:** Status shows memory system active for the department agent.

**Important requirement:** The Command Center must use memory-core (builtin backend), not an external paid memory service. The agent must confirm the memory layer is running with `memory.backend: builtin` and must fail the install if memory falls back to a different backend.

### 7.3 Verify the 5-Layer Memory Setup
The agent verifies that each department workspace has the required memory architecture:

1. Memory Flush
2. Session indexing
3. Google Embedding 2 or equivalent local retrieval layer
4. memory-core semantic memory (builtin backend)
5. Cognee / graph layer when enabled for the workspace

**Expected result:** Each department workspace is isolated and ready to store its own memory without mixing with Trevor's private memory or another client's workspace.

### 7.4 Test Dashboard
The agent verifies:
- Dashboard loads at localhost:4000
- All departments appear in the sidebar
- All 5 Kanban columns are visible
- Task creation works

### 7.5 Persona Runtime Test (Dynamic Selection Verification)

Send each department agent this message:
> "What persona are you currently operating as and why?"

**Then verify all three layers of dynamic selection:**

**Layer 1 - Search Evidence:**
Ask the agent: "How did you select this persona? Did you search the persona library or just pick a default?"

**Expected:** Agent describes running `gemini-search.py` (or a similar dynamic search) against the 40-persona library to find the top candidates. If the agent says "I always use [same persona]" without searching, the selection is static.

**FAIL if:** Agent says "I always use [same persona]" or "I default to the primary persona every time" -- this means the Dynamic Persona Selection Engine is not firing. The agent must perform a per-task search, not reuse the same persona every time.

**Layer 2 - 5-Layer Alignment:**
Ask the agent: "Explain the 8-layer alignment you used to select this persona."

**Expected:** Agent names and scores at least 3 of these 8 layers:
1. Owner values alignment
2. Company mission alignment
3. Business KPI alignment
4. Department KPI alignment
5. Task fit alignment

**FAIL if:** Agent cannot explain the alignment reasoning or gives a vague "it seemed like a good fit" without referencing specific layers.

**Layer 3 - Reason Log:**
Ask the agent: "Did you log your persona selection to today's daily memory file?"

**Expected:** Agent confirms it appended a reason log entry to `/data/clawd/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (where YYYY-MM-DD is today's date). Then verify the file directly:

```bash
cat /data/clawd/memory/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md | grep -i "selected.*persona"
```

**FAIL if:** No matching line exists in today's memory file. The Persona Operating Protocol requires a reason log entry for every task.

**Why this matters:** Department agents have `governing-personas.md` files and a Persona Operating Protocol in their AGENTS.md. But if the runtime wiring is broken, agents will skip the search, skip the alignment, skip the log, and just default to the same persona every time. This test catches all three failure modes before go-live.

**If an agent fails:** Check that their department AGENTS.md contains the `## 🔴🔴🔴 Persona Operating Protocol` section. If missing, append it manually and re-test. Also verify `scripts/gemini-search.py` exists and is executable.

### 7.6 Report Results
The agent sends you a summary in Telegram:
- Which departments are active
- Dashboard URL
- How to access each department topic
- Persona runtime test results (pass/fail per department)

---

## Persona Integration

The Command Center task cards display which AI persona each agent is using. Personas are coaching blueprints extracted from books (Skill 22 / Book-to-Persona system).

Each agent selects a persona based on the task type:
- Content tasks: copywriting personas (Russell B., Seth G.)
- Sales tasks: persuasion personas (Alex H., Dean G.)
- Creative tasks: storytelling personas (Donald M., Austin K.)
- Leadership tasks: strategy personas (Simon S., Jim C.)

The persona is displayed as a purple pill on each task card with the format: first name + last initial.

To populate personas for clients:
- Complete the 70-question business interview
- Match interview answers to persona trait suggestions in suggested-roles files
- The department head selects the right persona for each task
