# Fleet Standards

## Policy

The OpenClaw fleet enforces these mandatory standards on every installation and update:

### 1. Sub-Agents Fully Permitted

Sub-agents perform all labor operations (exec, file read/write, cross-agent spawns). They must never be permission-blocked. The canonical configuration enables:

- **Global sub-agent spawn**: `agents.defaults.subagents.allowAgents = ["*"]` (any target agent)
- **Per-agent override rule**: Every agent in `agents.list[]` that has an explicit `subagents.allowAgents` field must also be set to `["*"]`, OR that field must be deleted so it inherits the global default
- **Execution security**: `tools.exec.security = "full"` and `tools.exec.ask = "off"`
- **Sandbox mode**: Off (`agents.defaults.sandbox.mode = "off"` or undefined)

**Rationale**: The multi-agent orchestration model distributes labor across specialized agents. Blocking sub-agent spawns or tool access breaks the workflow automation that is the core value of a zero-human-company setup.

### 2. Telegram Media Limit 50 MB

Telegram bot API enforces a 50 MB hard ceiling on media uploads. The fleet standard sets:

```json
"channels": {
  "telegram": {
    "mediaMaxMb": 50
  }
}
```

This caps both **inbound and outbound** Telegram media to 50 MB per message. (Note: OpenClaw's documented default is 100 MB; 50 is a deliberate reduction to stay safely below the Telegram API hard limit.)

Can also be overridden per account via `channels.telegram.accounts.<account-id>.mediaMaxMb`.

### 3. Big Project Mode (universal operating standard)

Every client agent gets the **BIG PROJECT MODE** standard appended to its active
workspace `AGENTS.md`. It governs how the agent runs any large multi-part build
or document: the owner sends the project as a file; the orchestrator reads it
once and pastes the full text byte-identical at the top of every worker
sub-agent (assignment last), warms one worker before fanning out, keeps the
orchestrator skinny (ledger + deliverables on disk), and runs independent
numeric QC. On per-token caching models (DeepSeek direct, Anthropic, OpenAI)
this cuts input cost 80-95%; on flat-rate routes (Ollama Cloud) it is still
faster and cleaner.

The full client-universal reference is `BIG-PROJECT-MODE.md` at the repo root.
`apply-fleet-standards.sh` appends a compact version of the eight rules to the
agent's `AGENTS.md` idempotently (skipped if the `## BIG PROJECT MODE` heading
already exists).

## Source of Truth

Configuration verified against:
- docs.openclaw.ai/tools/subagents
- docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security
- docs.openclaw.ai/tools/multi-agent-sandbox-tools
- Live test on OpenClaw 2026.5.28 (Sheila Reynolds' Mac mini, session logs)

## Activation

Run `scripts/apply-fleet-standards.sh` during onboarding or update. The script:
1. Backs up `openclaw.json` with timestamp
2. Deep-merges the canonical fleet block
3. Validates with `openclaw config validate`
4. Appends the **BIG PROJECT MODE** section to the agent's active-workspace
   `AGENTS.md` (resolved the same way `install.sh` resolves it — per-agent
   `main` override, then `agents.defaults.workspace`, then the canonical
   `$OC_ROOT/workspace` default for Mac or VPS)
5. Reports before/after state and idempotent status

The script is idempotent: running it twice on an already-compliant box is a
no-op (config already canonical AND the `## BIG PROJECT MODE` heading already
present in `AGENTS.md`).

## Integration

- **Mac onboarding** (`openclaw-onboarding`): invoked from `install.sh` after core config is in place
- **VPS onboarding** (`openclaw-onboarding-vps`): invoked from the main setup flow
- **Updates**: both repos wire the script into their documented update paths so every `npm install -g openclaw@<ver>` run triggers standards reapplication
